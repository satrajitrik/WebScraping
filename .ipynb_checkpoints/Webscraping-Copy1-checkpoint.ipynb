      "utilization in an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>Modem digital networks are made to operate in a multimedia environment for transporting different types of data including pure data, i.e. files of alphanumeric characters, as well as data representing digitized and encoded voice, image, video\n",
      "signals etc. .  . The network should, naturally ensure compliance with a number of requirements specific to each kind of such data traffic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Different techniques have been developed for transporting data from one location to another, such as packet switching techniques where the data is arranged into packets.  Those packets may either be a predefined fixed length, like in Asynchronous\n",
      "Transfer Mode (ATM), or be variable in length, like in a Packet Type Multiplexing (PTM) mode of operation currently used for transporting voice.  The basic aim of both packet switching techniques, is to allow a statistical multiplexing of the different\n",
      "types of data onto transmission links to optimize, as much as possible, use of the available transmission bandwidth.  Consequently, a large number of networks, both public and private, have been developed for transporting those data throughout the world.\n",
      "<br/><br/>On the other hand, the evolution of telecommunication technologies in general, and of packet switching networks in particular, is driven by many factors among which the technology evolution factor and the application factors are worth being\n",
      "emphasized.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As far as technologies are concerned, obviously considerable progress has been achieved recently with the maturing of new transmission media.  High speed rates can now be sustained with very low error rates.  High bandwidth can be turned into\n",
      "profit for long distance networks as well as for high rate local networks.  Universal use of digital technologies appeared within both private and public telecommunication networks.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Due at least in part to the availability of these emerging technologies, many potential applications that were not possible in the past are now becoming accessible and attractive.  In this environment, generic requirements are now expressed by\n",
      "the users, such as:\n",
      "<br/><br/>Improving old applications.  Sub-second response times, which are achievable on low cost personal computers, have raised user expectations so that the lengthy wide area networks response times that were acceptable some years ago are today no\n",
      "longer tolerable.  The user interface can be improved, for example, with fast response full screen applications.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Enabling new applications.  Emerging applications like graphic, image, video and multimedia processing are generating large volumes of traffic.  These new applications, not considered feasible (or even thinkable) not too long ago, are now\n",
      "available and are generating an ever-increasing demand on bandwidth.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Optimizing communication networks.  There is a need for rationalizing the many disparate networks that major users have already implemented.  Investments can be optimized by integrating heterogeneous traffic like voice, video, and data over the\n",
      "same transport facilities regardless of protocols.  On the other hand, users want the opportunity to control their networking cost by choosing among the different price/performance options offered by the variety of vendors and carriers and to maximize\n",
      "their ability to take advantage of applications built on top of disparate underlying network technologies.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Accordingly, there has been an explosion in demand for high speed digital network facilities which is leading service providers to install core backbone networks to offer high speed data transportation facilities to large numbers of heterogeneous\n",
      "users' traffic, possibly through \"access backbones\".  Bandwidth offered through such service providers should be transparent to users and should offer fairly large communication bandwidth at optimal cost.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Service providers are now running or expect to run large ATM core backbone systems for use by users needing to transport data traffic between distant locations throughout the world.  Utilization of ATM core backbone systems makes particularly\n",
      "sense when the users traffic is multimedia in nature.\n",
      "<br/><br/>ATM networks are made to transport fixed length data packets, i.e,. 53 byte long packets having 5 bytes for a packet header and 48 bytes reserved to a data payload.  Different techniques have been developed to convert variable length packets\n",
      "(PTM) into ATM-like fixed length packets that can then be transported throught the ATM core backbone.  These techniques broadly include chopping the PTM packets into fixed length segments, assigning each segment a 5 byte long ATM-like header which\n",
      "enables forwarding the resulting fixed length packets into the ATM core network.  Since most PTM variable length packets will not be a multiple of preassigned conventional length, the last constructed ATM packet from each PTM packet will typically have\n",
      "less than 48 bytes of data payload and will need padding bits.  The padding bits carry no information and are considered overhead, which increases the bandwidth needed for a user's traffic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>For pure data providing fairly long and controllable packets, the added overhead is a relatively small portion of the overall traffic and thus may be ignored.  This is far from being the case for multimedia traffic and more particularly for voice\n",
      "traffic generating randomly distributed relatively short PTM packets.  For this kind of traffic, a method for transporting PTM originating data over an ATM network while minimizing overhead may result in significant savings for a customer leasing\n",
      "bandwidth in a service provider network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Any method which minimizes the creation of overhead can be expected to be welcomed by both the ATM core backbone owner in a competitive service provider environment and by the user leasing bandwidth from such backbone owner.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The present invention focuses on solving the overhead problem created when padding bits are generated during the conversion of variable length data packets into fixed length ATM packets (or cells).\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>This invention can be implemented as a method and system for optimizing transmission links bandwidth utilization in an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) packet switching network including switching nodes interconnected by high speed transmission\n",
      "links.  The network is one to be used to transport user data traffic including traffic originally existing as PTM traffic organized as variable length packets.  Each such PTM packet has a variable length data payload and a fixed length PTM packet header.

      "<br/><br/>Represented in FIG. 1 is a service provider's network (an ATM core backbone) including five nodes labeled N1,N2,N3,N4 and N5 interconnected by high speed links L1 through L7, which might be OC3/STM1 type of links.  This network may be used to\n",
      "interconnect users directly or via an access backbone system.  For instance, an ATM data source (1) may be connected to the ATM core backbone directly through node NI while a router (2) and PBXs (3) and (4) providing PTM type of traffic may be connected\n",
      "to the ATM core backbone indirectly through access backbone nodes N'1, N'2 and N'3 respectively.  Obviously, nodes N'1, N'2 and N'3 should provide facilities for converting from PTM to ATM modes and vice-versa.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As already mentioned, an ATM packet includes a 48 byte long data payload attached to a five byte long header.  The header concatenates a 1 byte long Header Error Control (HEC) field to a 4-byte long field mainly devoted to storing Virtual\n",
      "Path/Virtual Channel identifications (VP/VC) parameters used in switching the packet through the ATM network, but including few bits (e.g. 4 bits) for storing Generic Flow Control (GFC) data.  The Header Error Control (HEC) byte covers the entire ATM\n",
      "packet header and is used, in operation, for either single bit error correction or for multiple bit error detection.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Briefly stated, the HEC field value is calculated and recorded in the header when the packet enters the network.  The HEC field value recorded in the packet is cross-checked at a point of exit from the network with a locally recomputed HEC based\n",
      "on the information carried in the packet header.  The notation used to describe the error control is based on the property of cyclic codes.  The elements of an n-element code word are the coefficients of a polynomial of order (n-1).  These coefficients\n",
      "can have the value zero or one.  The polynomial representing the content of a header (excluding the HEC field) is generated using the first header bit as the coefficient of the highest order term.  The HEC field content is an 8 bit sequence representing\n",
      "the remainder of the division (modulo 2), by a predefined generator polynomial, of the product x.sup.8 multiplied by the content of the header excluding the HEC field.  The generator polynomial is defined in International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T)\n",
      "Recommendation I.432 as being x.sup.8 +x.sup.2 +x+1.  At the transmitter side, the initial content of a register of the device computing the remainder of the division, is preset to all zeros and is then modified by division of the header, excluding the\n",
      "HEC field, by the generator polynomial and the resulting remainder is transmitted as the 8-bits long HEC.  Again validity checking may be performed along the data path within the network by cross-checking the HEC received in the packet header with an HEC\n",
      "locally computed using the received header data.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The header contents, and more particularly the VPI/VCI fields, are changed in each traversed node within the ATM network.  To speed up the transfer process within a node, some node architectures include connection tables addressed by the incoming\n",
      "packet's VPI/VCI field content.  The connection tables provide the full outgoing packet header, including not only the new VPI/VCI information but also the precomputed HEC.  The validity checking may then be performed at the final receiving connection\n",
      "end.  For more details, one may refer to the European Patent Application, Publication Number 0000719065, with title \"Multipurpose Packet Switching Node for Data Communication Network\".\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring to FIG. 2, the PTM packet represented there includes a variable length payload with an original fixed length header comprising two control bytes (CB1 and CB2), two label bytes (LS1 and LS2) assuming packet orientation within the network\n",
      "is performed through label swapping, a control byte for conventional Linear Redundancy Checking operations (LRC), and, a variable number of bytes for the user's data.  Such a PTM packet may either be generated by a router (2) (see FIG. 1) or by a source\n",
      "PBX (3) processing essentially voice data.  Transportation of the PTM traffic over the ATM core backbone is conventionally made possible by converting the variable length PTM packets into ATM-like cells/packets.  The conversion may either be performed at\n",
      "an access backbone node (e.g. N'1) or at the ATM core backbone access node (e.g. N1).  Conventional converting methods (e.g. see the above mentioned European Patent application) include splitting the variable length payload into fixed length segments\n",
      "(e.g. 47 bytes long).  Then each segment is used to build an ATM-like cell.  To that end, a cyclic redundancy code checking byte (CRC8) is generated for the given segment and appended to the segment; and an ATM-like header including a 1 byte HEC value is\n",
      "generated to encapsulate the segment (see FIG. 2, step 2).\n",
      "<br/><br/>The last segment (identified by a one bit field in the header) typically needs to be padded with dummy bits to achieve the required segment length (48 bytes long) once a 4 byte long CRC (i.e. CRC32) value covering the whole original packet\n",
      "payload and padding bits have been added.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Padding bits are a waste of network bandwidth.  For fairly long and controllable data packets, as may be the case with pure data PTM packets provided by a router (2), the waste may be tolerable as it is a small fraction of the total data.  For\n",
      "relatively-short, randomly-provided PTM packets (e.g. voice packets), the waste is typically less tolerable as the necessary padding bits can be a greater fraction of the total data.\n",
      "<br/><br/>For instance, assume PBX (3) multiplexes up to thirty one voice channels (each providing four bytes representing 0.5 ms of voice data blocks) into a PTM frame.  The user data payload for each frame may vary between 4 bytes and 124 bytes. \n",
      "Obviously, segmenting and converting such PTM packets into ATM packets, with inclusion of padding bits as mentioned above, leads to a serious waste in overall network bandwidth.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The present invention is a method and system for minimizing lost bandwidth and optimizing ATM network bandwidth utlization, particularly for voice traffic.  The invention can be implemented for existing networks which, from business and\n",
      "engineering standpoints, is highly significant.  The goals are achieved by compressing and reshaping voice packets.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring to FIG. 3.  A conventional PTM voice packet represented as frame (1) includes the two control bytes (CH1, CH2), the two label bytes (LS1, LS2), a one byte long checking field (LRC) and the user data bytes labeled H1, H2, H3, H4,etc.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A working assumption is the control bytes (CB1, CB2) are always the same for a given type of traffic.  The control bytes may be dropped (or transferred into the payload) at the ATM entry node (e.g, node N1 in FIG. 1) and then reinserted at the\n",
      "network exit node (e.g. node N3 for a connection between PBX 3 and PBX 4).  The two byte long field that becomes available can be used for a flag (F) identifying the packet as originating from PTM traffic and a count (CNT) indicating the length of the\n",
      "voice packet.  The LRC is replaced by an HEC field (see frame 2 in FIG. 3).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Assuming the most significant bit of the Generic Flow Control (GFC) field in an ATM cell is used in this invention as a one bit flag (F) (see frame 4), then, both headers of PTM and ATM packet frames match perfectly as far as flag F and header\n",
      "HEC locations within the respective frames are concerned.  In this invention, an ATM packet is discriminated from a PTM packet by the flag value.  F=0 designates an ATM packet while F=1 designates a PTM packet.  The count (CNT) field is used to locate a\n",
      "PTM packet end while an ATM packet end is always 48 bytes after the header HEC.  In operation, one may assume that these PTM header \"compression\" operations are performed in an access backbone node (e.g. N'2), or in a port (e.g. N1) to the ATM backbone\n",
      "network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A further compression of a PTM (e.g. voice) packet is represented in frame 3 in FIG. 3, which is used in the preferred mode of implementation of this invention.  The 2 byte long label (LS1/LS2) is compressed into a seven bit long label LAB which\n",
      "can identify up to 128 connections.  Then the first byte may represent the flag (F) and the label (LAB); the second byte is used for CNT and the fifth byte field is reserved for HEC.  The third and fourth byte fields are the freed for data.  Obviously,\n",
      "one may choose a label of a different length to identify a different number of connections.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Then during operation, the PTM packet delineation state diagram shall match to the cell delineation state diagram as defined in the ITU-T Recommendations 1.432, but for the CNT function meant to localize a packet ending.  Such a state diagram is\n",
      "represented in FIG. 4.  Packet delineation is performed by using the correlation between the header bits to be protected (4*8=32 bits) and the relevant control bits (8 bits) introduced in the header by the HEC using a shortened cyclic code with the\n",
      "generating polynomial (x.sup.8 +x.sup.2 +x+1).  The state diagram loops into three states designated as \"Hunt\", \"Presynch\", and \"Synch\".  In the \"Hunt\" state (40), the delineation process is performed by checking bit by bit, within the header bits, for\n",
      "the correct HEC.  In other words, the HEC is computed sequentially on the incoming bits, starting with the flag F and up to the last bit of fourth received byte, and the system checks for matching with the fifth received byte (i.e. HEC).  Once agreement\n",
      "is found (correct HEC) the method enters into \"Presynch\" state (41) for confirmation by checking packet by packet for the correct HEC over a predefined number of packets.  The only difference between ATM and compressed PTM will then lie in the fact that\n",
      "next ATM cell/packet end is at 48 bytes distance from HEC, while PTM packet end shall depend on the count indicated by the CNT field content.  Both packet/cell end tracking are triggered and differentiated by the flag F value.  If an incorrect HEC (HEC\n",
      "error) is found, the process returns to the \"Hunt\" state (40).  Otherwise it enters into \"Synch\" state (42).  This first predefined number of consecutive correct HECs has been selected to be equal to six in the preferred embodiment of this invention as\n",
      "suggested by the ITU-T Recommendations I.432.  In the \"Synch\" state the packet delineation will be assumed to be lost (HEC error) if an incorrect HEC is obtained a second predefined number of times consecutively.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 5 shows an algorithm for implementing the \"Hunt\" state to search for synchronism assuming a PTM packet (F=1) is being processed.  The received frame header bits are serially fed into Hunt operation (50) for HEC computation based on the above\n",
      "mentioned generator polynomial.  Then, a test for checking with the received HEC field content is performed (51).  In case of negative test, the process loops back to (50).  Otherwise, \"Presynch\" state (52) is entered and the CNT count field content is\n",
      "looked for (53), with counter CNT which is being dynamically incremented.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The system goes then to \"Presynch\" and \"Synch\" algorithms as represented in FIG. 6.  A check on count field content, i.e. CNT, is first processed (61) and as long as the CNT value is not reached, count tracking continues on a byte by byte basis. \n",
      "Once the count is reached, the header is checked for validity (62).  Should the tracked HEC be invalid, the process goes back to \"Hunt\" state (63/50), otherwise it branches to check for \"Synch\" state (64).  In case of positive match, the process goes to\n",
      "step (65) to get the count (CNT) and get the packet accordingly.  Otherwise, should the result of test (64) be negative, the process goes to get the count (CNT) and increase Hit Count (66) and check for six Hit_Counts (67).  As long as six hit counts are\n",
      "not reached, the process continues until six hit_counts to declare \"Synch\" state.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As already mentioned, the invention is particularly attractive because it may apply to ATM core backbones or networks already available in the field.  It is implementable into available network node architectures without a need for redesign of\n",
      "either node hardware or software.  It may be implemented as a Line Interface Card to be attached to any link connected to a preexisting node to be operated in hybrid mode (both ATM and PTM traffic).\n",
      "<br/><br/>A conventional node architecture is schematically represented in FIG. 7.  The network node is connected to both ATM and PTM trunks through a set of receive adapters on receive side and a set of transmit adapters on the transmit side.  Both sets\n",
      "of adapters are interconnected through an ATM Switch fabric which processes ATM shaped packets/cells only.  Since the Switch is made to operate on ATM (fixed length) cells, variable length traffic (PTM) is segmented in the adapters into ATM cells for\n",
      "switching purposes, while the ATM traffic is switched almost directly.  Both are however arranged into a format including, in addition to a conventional ATM-like packet (ATM header (5 bytes) plus payload (48 bytes)), the following information:\n",

      "<br/><br/>As far as routing is concerned, routing from input (receive) adapter to output (transmit) adapter via the ATM Switch fabric, is essentially based on the label swapping in the packet header, each label designating a node output trunk to reach the\n",

      "<br/><br/>To get the control bytes CB1 and CB2, the system may either fetch these back from the payload where they may have been inserted, or reconstruct these based on the type of traffic involved.  For instance, as shown in FIG. 1 the PTM connection\n",

      "<br/><br/>As for the labels LS1 and LS2, these may either have been left unchanged as in frame 2 (see FIG. 3) or they may have been removed (see frame 3 in FIG. 3).  In the latter case the labels could have been reinserted into the PTM frame payload during\n",
      "header compression, in which case they may now be fetched back therefrom, or they may have been converted into a compressed label (LAB).  To understand the label compression, one may recall the label generation rationale.  In a conventional ATM network,\n",
      "the connections between say PBX3 and PBX4 (see FIG. 1) are either established upon users' requests or under predefined circumstances (e.g. link failure recovery procedure).  On both occasions, a connection path procedure is used to define the preferred\n",
      "path throughout the PTM network trunks and nodes, between the two PBX's.  Then a connection set-up message is forwarded, by a network management device along said path, to reserve the selected path and enable fully defining each required node facilities. For instance, each network node may include a Trunk Connection Manager (TCM) which shall drive the operations performed to define the connections between node input and output channels.  For instance, assuming the path under consideration runs into link\n",
      "5 connecting node N2 to node N3 (see FIG. 1), then node N2 Trunk Connection Manager (TCM2) and node N3 Trunk Connection Manager (TCM3) are both involved in the process.  In that case TCM3 drives the process and assigns the labels which are then stored\n",
      "into those nodes'PTM Connection Tables.\n",
      "<br/><br/>During a label compression operation, several assumptions may have been made.  For instance, since in the preferred embodiment of this invention the required number of connections is limited, then the label allocations in, say, N3, is made in a\n",
      "known range (particularly true for voice connections).  Assuming the least significant bits in the seven bit long LAB field are reserved to LS1, the others to LS2.  Accordingly, in that case the compressed label LAB enables reconstruction of the original\n",
      "labels LS1 and LS2, each one byte long.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The original decompressed header components CB1, CB2, LS1 and LS2 are now available.  A checking byte has to be computed.  According to PTM traffic conventions, this checking byte is computed as a Length Redundancy Check (LRC) byte derived from a\n",
      "modulo 2 sum of the decompressed header components, CB1, CB2, LS1 and LS2.  In fact, these may be simply XORed.  This terminates header decompression operations (113), once the LRC has been inserted in the field freed by the above mentioned skipped HEC.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To recover the original PTM frame, all is that is needed is to reconstruct the original payload.  The operations are obvious.  If some payload bytes (see B1 and B2 in FIG. 3 frame 3) had been transferred into the compressed header, they are now\n",
      "transferred back to their original locations.  On the other hand, if some of the original header bytes (e.g. CB1, CB2, LS1 ,LS2) were transferred into the payload, they shall have been transferred back during the header decompression operations (113). \n",
      "Finally the original frame 1 (see FIG. 3) is obtained.  However, to enable attachment of the Receive Adapter LIC to the existing ATM node architecture, the Receive Adapter LIC must provide ATM-like cells coherent with ATM packets/cells received on the\n",
      "Receive Adapter LIC as provided by pure ATM traffic.  Accordingly, segmentation operations shall be performed in (114), with padding bits if required.  These operations are performed according to the AAL5 standard process as already described.\n",
      "<br/><br/>According to the above-mentioned criteria chosen for the preferred embodiment of this invention, the ATM-like cells derived from PTM traffic after segmentation in (114) are buffered and assigned the Virtual Channel (VCI) 33.  Therefore,\n",
      "discrimination performed in the Receive Adapter Section of the Node between ATM cells derived from ATM traffic and cells derived from PTM traffic is based on VCI value, with those bearing a VCI different from 33 being oriented toward Routing (115). \n",
      "Naturally, it should be understood that prior to any such dispatching, cell validity may have been checked based on CRC8 (see FIG. 9).  CRC validity checking is not represented in FIG. 10.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As for the ATM cells transported over VCI=33, such cells are submitted to AAL5 reassembly operations while the validity is being checked for the PTM packet being reassembled, via CRC32 checking.  This again means, for each PTM packet to be\n",
      "reconstructed, starting with the 48-byte long payload of the first segment/cell provided (114), starting a new CRC32 computation, storing the computation result, as a partial CRC, in a local memory control block.  This partial CRC is then updated with\n",
      "all next intermediate payloads belonging to same PTM packet, down to the last (identified properly), and then compared with the CRC32 stored in the assigned field of last segment, for PTM packet validity checking (116).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Once reassembled, the packets are properly routed (117).  For instance, control traffic may be directed to the current node and be processed accordingly.  As for other PTM origin traffic (e.g. voice traffic), once reassembled and routed, it is\n",
      "again segmented in (118) (e.g. AAL5 segmentation) and processed as disclosed with reference to FIG. 9, which means for instance encapsulation with ATM header, HEC insertion, as well as CRC32 generation/update (due to padding bits).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Finally, for each ATM cell being generated, be it from pure ATM, via routing (115) or deriving from segmentation in (118), a cell CRC8 is generated (not shown in FIG. 10) and reinserted as required.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The above is a simplified version of the Receive Adapter which might also include several improvements like, for instance, a backpressure mechanism to enable further regulating the traffic.  In conclusion, those skilled in the art of digital\n",
      "communication network will appreciate the advantages of the proposed method for optimizing link bandwidth utilization by PTM traffic, e.g. voice traffic.  The invention is fairly simple to implement and is transparent to existing networks.  No\n",
      "modification of hardware or software of existing networks are required since a fairly simple Line Interface Adapter can be installed in existing network node adapters.\n",

      "bytes).  Then a conventional PTM packet will have 4*31=124 bytes, plus 6 bytes for header and trailer, which makes 130 byte long packets.  The AAL5 segmentation operations breaks these into 3 cells.  With cell overhead needed to get ATM-like cells, each\n",
      "E1 connection requires (3*(48+5)*8)/0.5=2544 Kbps.  Also assuming an OC3/STM1 link, with a 149768 Kbps bandwidth, and assuming the network operating between 85% and 96% bandwidth reservation, then the number of E1 connections per OC3/STM1 would be\n",

      "invention relates to electrical cables used for connecting computers and other electrical equipment together and more particularly to a shunt that fits inside the cable connector and reliably couples different wires in the connector together.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Computer cables are used for transferring information between computers and other electrical systems.  Connector on the ends of the cables have pins that connect to interface circuitry in the computer.  Often the same electrical signal in the\n",
      "cable is used on multiple pins on the cable connector.  For example, more than one pin in the connector is often grounded.  It is difficult to reliably couple common signals together on the connector.  For example, any wires that connect connector pins\n",
      "together call eventually disconnect due to constant insertion and removal of the connector into a mating plug.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Depending on the type of interface associated with the cable, not all of the wires in the cable may be used.  To reduce signal interference, the unused wires are required to be tied together.  Tying or soldering together cable wires is time\n",
      "consuming.  A small connector housing might not have enough space to hold a pigtail wire connection or multiple unused cable wires that have to be soldered together.  Because coupling wires together inside a connector is unreliable or impractical, jumper\n",
      "wiles are often used inside the computer system to couple common signal pins together.\n",
      "<br/><br/>However, it is often impractical to use jumper wires inside a computer.  For example, there are 6 primary serial interface standards currently used in the computer industry.  Each interface standard has a different signal configuration when\n",
      "operating in a Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) mode and a different signal configuration when operating in a Data Circuit Terminating Equipment (DCE) mode.  A generic interface cable and generic interface circuitry is used to connect the different types of\n",
      "serial interfaces together.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Some signals in the generic interface cable are required to be terminated when not used.  Since different signals are used for each interface, different termination configurations are required for different serial interfaces.  It is impractical\n",
      "to use jumper wires to connect the common signals together inside the computer system since the wired connections would have to be manually changed each time a different serial interface is used.  Changing jumper wires is time consuming and also requires\n",
      "a computer system operator to have sophisticated knowledge of the electrical characteristics for each serial interface.  There is also a need to electronically identify the type of generic interface cable so that generic interface circuitry in the\n",
      "computer system can be automatically reconfigured for the specific interface associated with the cable.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Accordingly, a need remains for an electrical cable that quickly and reliably shunts different combinations of wires together inside a cable.\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>An electrical cable according to the invention includes a connector containing an electrically conductive shunt.  The shunt includes multiple electrically conductive clips that shunt selected wires in the connector together.  The clips can be\n",
      "removed so different combinations of wires can be shunted together.  The clips each comprise a pair of vertically aligned fingers forming slots that extend up from the sides of a shunt mounting plate.  The fingers on each clip include oppositely aligned\n",
      "tapered top ends forming a wide opening floor receiving the cable wires.  The clips extend longitudinally along an entire front end and longitudinally along an entire rear end of the mounting plate.  The clips on the front end of the shunt are offset\n",
      "from the clips in the rear end so that each clip aligns with only one wire in a connector wire guide.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The fingers apply lateral oppositely opposing forces against the insulated cover.  The lateral force applied by the clips provides a secure electrical connection that does not weaken even when the connections between other parts of the connector\n",
      "loosen over time.  The shunt is used for terminating unused wires in a generic serial interface cable.  A different shunt configuration is used for each cable to uniquely identify the type of interface associated with the cable.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention which proceeds with reference to the accompanying\n",
      "drawings. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 1 an exploded perspective view of an electrical connector containing a shunt according to the invention.\n",

      "<br/><br/>FIG. 4 is a perspective view showing the electrical connector shown in FIG. 1 in an assembled condition. <br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring to FIG. 1, a connector 10 according to the invention includes a connector body 26 that receives wires 16 from a cable 14.  The connector body 26 is sandwiched between a lower cover 22 and upper cover 36 each including formed wire guides\n",
      "23.  A shunt 24 is located between cover 22 and connector body 26.  A lower metal plate 20 and an upper metal plate 38 extend around the outside surface of lower cover 22 and upper cover 36 shielding electrical signals in connector 10 from\n",
      "electro-magnetic interference.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The wires 16 in cable 14 are individually located in the connector body 26 and coupled to pins 29 extending from a front end of connector body 26.  An alignment bracket 30 fits around the pins 29 and a mating receptor 28 fits over the alignment\n",
      "bracket 30 and attaches to the front end of connector body 26.  A metal band 32 is wrapped around the cable 14 to provide strain relief.  An overmold 34 is molded to the cable 14 providing additional strain relief for cable 14.  A lower housing 18 and an\n",
      "upper housing 40 hold all the other pieces of the connector 10 together.  Screws 12 threadingly engage with a mating receptor on a computer system (not shown).\n",
      "<br/><br/>An assembled partial cutaway view of connector 10 is shown in FIG. 4.  The metal plates 38 and 20 in one embodiment are made out of steel.  The connector body 26, covers 22 and 36 and housings 18 and 40 are preferably made out of plastic.  The\n",
      "shunt 12 is preferably made of a highly conductive material such as copper.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring to FIG. 2, the shunt 24 includes an electrically conductive mounting plate 48 having a front end 60 and a rear end 62.  Multiple electrically conductive clips 42 extend up from the front end 60 and the rear end 62 of mounting plate 48. \n",
      "The clips 42 each receive and electrically couple to associated wires 16 (FIG. 1) in cable 14.  The clips 42 in combination with the mounting plate 48 shunt together selected wires in cable 14.  The clips 42 each comprise a pair of vertically aligned\n",
      "finger is 44 extending upward perpendicular with a top surface of the mounting plate 48.  The fingers 44 on each clip 42 form a slot 45.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The fingers 44 on each clip 42 include oppositely tapering top ends 43 forming a wide openinig 47 at the top end 43 of fingers 44 that narrows toward a bottom end 49.  Multiple alignment holes 46 in the mounting plate 48 receive alignment members\n",
      "54 extending up from a bottom surface of cavity 52.  In one embodiment, perforations 58 are formed across the bottom end 49 of each clip 42 next to the mounting plate 48.  The perforations 58 allow selected clips 42 to be snapped off when the wire\n",
      "associated with the clip is not shunted to another wire in the cable 14.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Holes 46 in mounting plate 48 receive the alignment members 54 and keep the shunt 24 front moving in cavity 52.  Extensions 57 and 59 only allow the shunt 24 to he inserted into cavity 52 in a single direction so that the front end 60 of the\n",
      "shunt 24 is always aligned with the same end of the cover 22.  The extension 57 is wider than extension 59.  Thus, only a narrower notched top end 61 of shunt 24 can be inserted at the end of caviety 52 with extension 57.\n",
      "<br/><br/>If shunt 24 were inserted backwards into cavity 52 then the clips 42 would be misaligned with the wile guides 23 shorting the wrong wires together.  Thus, the holes 46 and alignment members 54 ensure the shunt 24 is always coupled to the correct\n",
      "wires 16 in cable 14.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The clips 42 extend longitudinally along the front end 60 and longitudinally along the real end 62 of the mounting plate 48.  The clips 42 on the front end 60 are offset from the clips 42 along the cell end 62 so that no two clips 42 are aligned\n",
      "at the same longitudinal position on the mounting plate 48.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring to FIG. 3, when the shunt 24 is placed in cavity 52, the clips 42 each align with one of the wire guide channels 23 in cover 22.  Clips 42 are selectively sheered off from mounting plate 48.  The clips 42 for wires that are to be\n",
      "shunted together are not sheered off from mounting plate 48.  When the cover 22 and the shunt 24 are pressed against the connector body 26, the wires 16 sit along the wire guide channels 23.  The wires 16 insert into the top ends 47 of clip slots 45.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The wires 16 each include an insulated cover 17.  The shunt fingers 44 apply oppositely opposing lateral forces that cut through the insulation 17 when the covers 22 and 36 are pressed together.  The fingers 44 then provide a gas tight electrical\n",
      "displacement connection (IDC) with the wires 16.  All the wires connected to clips 42 are then shunted together through conductive mounting plate 48.  All the pieces of the connector 10 shown in FIG. 1 are pressed together and ultrasonically bonded.  The\n",
      "ultrasonic process causes the plastic pieces in connector 10 to reflow and bond together.  The ultrasonic bonding process used for bonding plastic pieces together is well known in the art and is therefore not explained in further detail.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Any type of signals can be shunted together.  For example, one of the wires 16 in cable 16 can be a ground wire.  Any other wires in connector 10 that need to be grounded are then shunted to the ground wire by shunt 24.  Alternatively, voltage,\n",
      "data or control signals call be shunted to multiple wires in connector 10.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The fingers 44 apply lateral pressure to opposite sides of the wire 16.  This unique arrangement of the fingers 44 on shunt 24 not only ensures a reliable connection with the wires 16 but also provides additional strain relief for the wires when\n",
      "the connector pins are inserted and removed from a mating connector (not shown).\n",
      "<br/><br/>The fingers 44 ensure a secure electrical connection even if the other pieces of connector 10 become slightly loose over time.  The integrity of the electrical connection between the wire 16 and shunt 24 is only dependant on the lateral pressure\n",
      "that fingers 44 exert against the opposite sides of the wire 16 and is independent of how tight the other pieces of connector 10 are held together.  Thus, if pieces of the assembled connector 10 become loose over time, the electrical integrity between\n",
      "wires 16 and shunt 24 is not effected.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The shunt 24 is used in combination with the generic serial connector described in co-pending patent application Ser.  No. 09/001,352 filed Dec.  31, 1997 to Chapman Entitled: \"Generic Serial Interface with Automatic Reconfigurability\" which is\n",
      "herein incorporated by reference.  The shunt 24 is used to identify different types of generic transition cables associated with different serial interfaces.  The shunt 24 grounds mode wires in the connector 10 that are then used to identify the type of\n",
      "serial interface associated with the transition cable.  Generic interface circuitry in the computer system reads the mode signals shunted by the shunt 24 and accordingly reconfigures the generic interface circuitry to operate with the identified serial\n",
      "interface.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Depending upon the type of serial interface, different signals in the transition cable are not used.  To improve integrity for the signals that are used, the unused signals are required to be grounded.  Generic interface circuitry in the computer\n",
      "system tri-states the unused signals.  The wires 16 in the cable 14 associated with the unused signals are then shunted to ground by the shunt 24.  Thus, wires do not have to be manually tied together inside the connector.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Having described and illustrated the principles of the invention in a preferred embodiment thereof, it should be apparent that the invention can be modified in arrangement and detail without depairing from such principles.  I claim all\n",

      "<br/><br/>This invention relates in general to data communication, and more particularly to a communication server apparatus having distributed switching and method.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>A communication server provides access to communication facilities.  For example, a communication server having a bank of modems may provide subscriber access to the modems for data communication.  A communication server may be associated with\n",
      "its own dedicated communication network, or with an existing communication network, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN).\n",
      "<br/><br/>As communication networks provide greater connectivity and access to information, there is an increasing demand for data communication at higher rates.  One solution to provide increased data rates replaces existing twisted pair wiring with high\n",
      "bandwidth media, such as coaxial cables or fiber optic links.  Other solutions adopt improved communication techniques using the existing hardware infrastructure.  For example, digital subscriber line (XDSL) technology provides higher bandwidth data\n",
      "service over existing twisted pair wiring.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To deliver data service to the subscriber, a communication server may provide a dedicated or permanent connection to its communication facilities.  For example, an existing communication server at a central office provides enough communication\n",
      "facilities to simultaneously service all PSTN subscribers.  However, all telephone subscribers may not desire data service.  Furthermore, the subscribers that desire data service may not simultaneously access the communication server.\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>In accordance with the present invention, the disadvantages and problems associated with communication servers have been substantially reduced or eliminated.  In particular, a communication server apparatus having distributed switching and method\n",
      "are disclosed that provide data service to a number of subscribers using a reduced number of XDSL communication facilities.\n",
      "<br/><br/>According to one aspect of the present invention, a communication server includes a modem pool that comprises a plurality of XDSL modems.  The communication server also includes a plurality of line interface modules.  Each line interface module\n",
      "has a plurality of inputs each coupled to a twisted pair data line and has a plurality of outputs each coupled to one of the XDSL modems.  Each line interface module operates to detect a need for data service on a requesting twisted pair data line and to\n",
      "couple the requesting twisted pair data line to an output associated with a selected XDSL modem.  A controller is coupled to the XDSL modems and to the plurality of line interface modules.  The controller operates to select one of the XDSL modems in\n",
      "response to a detected need for data service.  The controller further operates to direct the line interface module to which a requesting twisted pair data line is coupled to couple the requesting twisted pair data line to the output associated with the\n",
      "selected XDSL modem.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Important technical advantages of the present invention include a communication server that provides data service to a number of subscribers using a reduced number of XDSL communication facilities.  Over-subscription of data service is\n",
      "accomplished by selectively coupling a number of twisted pair data lines to a reduced number of XDSL modems.  A controller polls the data lines in succession to determine which subscribers of the communication system need data service.  Upon detecting a\n",
      "need for data service on a selected data line, the controller directs a switch to couple the selected data line to an available modem.  The communication server may then provide data service suitable for high bandwidth applications, such as\n",
      "video-on-demand, multimedia, or Internet access.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another important technical advantage of the present invention includes a communication server that provides over-subscribed XDSL data service using the existing infrastructure of the public switched telephone network (PSTN).  Asymmetric digital\n",
      "subscriber line (ADSL), symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL), high-speed digital subscriber line (HDSL), very high-speed digital subscriber line (VDSL), or other suitable XDSL technology can provide higher bandwidth data service over existing twisted\n",
      "pair wiring.  These technologies may support data service simultaneously with traditional telephone service using a separation technique, such as frequency division multiplexing.  In one embodiment, a splitter divides each incoming twisted pair\n",
      "subscriber line into a twisted pair phone line and a twisted pair data line.  The phone line is coupled to a telephone switch to provide telephone service and the data line is coupled to the communication server to provide over-subscribed XDSL data\n",
      "service.  The communication server and splitter may be located at a central office of the PSTN.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another important technical advantage of the present invention includes the management and monitoring of XDSL data service provided to subscribers.  To accomplish this, the communication server maintains an activity table to determine status\n",
      "information on twisted pair data lines and XDSL modems.  In addition, the communication server can track subscriber usage, monitor subscriber information and generate billing and demographic information.  In a particular embodiment, an activity detector\n",
      "disconnects a subscriber after a predetermined period of inactivity to release a modem for use by another subscriber.\n",
      "<br/><br/>An important technical advantage of the present invention is the distribution of the switching function to allow scalability of the number of supported data lines and over-subscription of XDSL modems.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A further important technical advantage of the present invention includes isolating the switch from the data lines and subscriber lines.  The switch can thereby operate without constraints imposed by technical requirements for interaction with\n",
      "the data lines and subscriber lines.  For example, isolation of the switching matrix allows CMOS switches to be used rather than more expensive solid state relays or mechanical relays.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Yet another important technical advantage of the present invention includes the ability to provide a two-wire isolated interface that can use a single switch to couple a data line to a specific modem.  The present invention thus allows one switch\n",
      "per modem per data line configuration.  The isolation system of the present invention can transform the data line impedance to an intermediate impedance in order to increase system performance.  Other important technical advantages are readily apparent\n",
      "to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n",

      "<br/><br/>FIG. 1 illustrates a communication system 10 that provides both telephone and data service to a subscriber 12.  A central office 14 is coupled to subscriber 12 using subscriber line 16.  In operation, central office 14 provides telephone and data\n",
      "service to subscriber 12 using subscriber line 16.  Subscriber line 16 supports simultaneous telephone and data service using twisted pair wiring.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Subscriber 12 includes a telephone 20 and a computer 22, both coupled to an interface 24.  A splitter 25 is coupled to subscriber line 16 and operates to split subscriber line 16 into a twisted pair phone line 26 and a twisted pair data line 28. \n",
      "Phone line 26 is coupled to telephone 20 using interface 24.  Similarly, data line 28 is coupled to computer 22 using interface 24.  Subscriber 12 refers to one or more components at the subscriber premises shown in FIG. 1, as well as the user of these\n",
      "components.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Telephone 20 is a traditional telephone transceiver, a cordless telephone transceiver, or any other device suitable for allowing communication over telephone line 26.  Computer 22 comprises a mainframe device, mini-frame device, server, desktop\n",
      "personal computer, notebook personal computer, or other suitable computing device having an XDSL modem 30 that communicates data using data line 28.  Modem 30 couples to other components of computer 22 using a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus,\n",
      "an Industrial Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, a Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) interface, or any other suitable technology that provides input/output capability to computer 22.  The selection and design of modem 30 for\n",
      "computer 22 may depend on the type or functionality of computer 22, as well as the data service rate supported by data line 28.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Modem 30 transmits and receives data in communication system 10 using any suitable digital subscriber line technology, referred to generally as XDSL.  Modem 30 also supports Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, V.35 data protocol, frame relay, asynchronous\n",
      "transfer mode (ATM), switched multi-megabit data service (SMDS), high-level data link control (HDLC), serial line Internet protocol (SLIP), point-to-point protocol (PPP), transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), or any other appropriate\n",
      "protocol, collectively referred to as digital protocol.  For example, computer 22 may include a network interface 31 to receive data from central office 14 or to further communicate data to a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or other\n",
      "suitable network coupled to computer 22 using link 18.  In general, modem 30 translates information between the communication protocol supported by communication system 10 and the digital protocol supported by computer 22.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Communication system 10 includes numerous other twisted pair subscriber lines 16 coupled to other subscribers 12.  In an exemplary embodiment, central office 14 provides phone and data service to one thousand subscribers, with each subscriber 12\n",
      "including one or more components described above at its premises.  The subscribers and subscriber lines in communication system 10 are referred to collectively in the plural as subscribers 12 and subscriber lines 16.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Interface 24 couples phone line 26 to telephone 20, and data line 28 to computer 22.  In one embodiment, interface 24 provides additional couplings to additional telephones 20 and computers 22 at subscriber 12.  Splitter 25 is a passive or active\n",
      "splitter that divides subscriber line 16 into phone line 26 and data line 28 of the same type.  Throughout this description, phone line 26 and data line 28 may be referred to specifically, or collectively as part of subscriber line 16.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Subscriber line 16 couples subscriber 12 to central office 14.  Subscriber line 16 comprises twisted pair wiring that is commonly installed at subscriber premises and as the local loop in many public switched telephone networks (PSTNs). \n",
      "Subscriber line 16 may be unshielded twisted pair (UTP), shielded twisted pair (STP), or other suitable type or category of twisted pair wiring made of copper or other suitable material.  Phone line 26 and data line 28 associated with subscriber line 16\n",
      "may be the same or different type or category of twisted pair wiring.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Central office 14 includes a splitter 50 coupled to subscriber line 16.  Like splitter 25 at subscriber 12, splitter 50 at central office 14 is a passive or active splitter that divides subscriber line 16 into a twisted pair phone line 52 and a\n",
      "twisted pair data line 54.  Phone line 52 and data line 54 associated with subscriber line 16 may be the same or different type or category of twisted pair wiring.  A telephone switch 56 at central office 14 is coupled to phone line 52 to provide plain\n",
      "old telephone system (POTS) service to subscriber 12.  Telephone switch 56 also represents other components in the PSTN or other suitable voice communication network, such as switches, wireline or wireless links, satellites, microwave uplinks, and other\n",
      "communication facilities to deliver telephone service to subscriber 12.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A communication server 58 is coupled to splitter 50 using data line 54.  As described in detail below, communication server 58 manages the provisioning of data service to subscriber 12.  Communication server 58 performs off-hook detection to\n",
      "determine if subscriber 12 desires data service.  Specifically, communication server 58 couples a modem to subscriber line 16 upon detecting a need for data service from computer 22.  Communication server 58 tracks subscriber usage, monitors subscriber\n",
      "information, and generates billing and demographic information, as described below.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The data off-hook detector in communication server 58 can use one of several methods to determine whether subscriber 12 should be connected to an XDSL modem.  The off-hook detector may monitor direct current voltages, electrical tones, data link\n",
      "frames, or any other protocol or data sequencing to determine whether subscriber 12 needs data access.  The off-hook detector in communication server 58 may monitor electrical tones generated by modem 30 while in the process of training, notching,\n",
      "equalizing, or performing any other task that puts electrical tones onto subscriber line 16 and its associated data line 54.  Communication server 58 may also detect frames or packets.  These frames or packets could be Ethernet, ATM, HDLC, or any\n",
      "suitable data communications frame format.  The off-hook detector in communication server 58 could also examine various protocols such as TCP/IP, PPP, or any other suitable network protocol or data stream.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Communications server 58 multiplexes modem digital outputs into a multiplexed digital line 62 for delivery to a router or other network device 60.  In one embodiment, multiplexed digital line 62 carries a single bidirectional and multiplexed\n",
      "signal for all subscribers 12 in communication system 10.  Signals on multiplexed digital line 62 may support any appropriate digital protocol used by network device 60.  A communication network 64, such as a global communication network like the\n",
      "Internet, is coupled to network device 60.  Communication network 64 may also include a synchronous optical network (SONET), a frame relay network, an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network, a T1, T3, E1, or E3 network, or any other suitable\n",
      "communication network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>One important technical advantage of the present invention is the ability to over-subscribe the XDSL communication facilities of communication server 58 to service an increasing number of subscribers 12 in communication system 10.  Communication\n",
      "server 58 may couple to the same number and type of data lines 54 as represented by subscriber lines 16 in communication system 10.  For example, if central office 14 services one thousand subscribers 12 using twisted pair subscriber lines 16, then data\n",
      "lines 54 coupled to communication server 58 may represent as many as one thousand twisted pair lines.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In one embodiment, not all subscribers 12 in communication system 10 desire access to data service provided by communication server 58.  Splitter 50 need not provide a separate data line 54 for those subscribers 12 that only desire phone service\n",
      "from telephone switch 56.  As more subscribers 12 desire access to data service, the XDSL communication capabilities of splitter 50 and communication server 58 may be supplemented in a modular and cost effective manner to meet the demand.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Communication system 10 supports data service over subscriber lines 16 using asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL), high-speed digital subscriber line (HDSL), very high-speed digital subscriber line\n",
      "(VDSL), or any other suitable technology that allows high rate data service over twisted pair wiring.  All of these technologies are referred to collectively as XDSL or communication protocol.  In one embodiment, subscriber line 16 and components of\n",
      "subscriber 12 and central office 14 support communication using ADSL techniques that comply with ANSI standard T1.413.  In another embodiment, ADSL communication over subscriber line 16 may be performed using the carrier-less amplitude phase modulation\n",
      "(CAP) technique developed by AT&amp;T Corporation.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In an ADSL communication system, the downlink data rate 32 from central office 14 to subscriber 12 is greater than the uplink data rate 34 from subscriber 12 to central office 14.  This allows high bandwidth communication to subscriber 12, while\n",
      "still providing lower bandwidth communication to central office 14.  ADSL communication is well-adapted for applications, such as video-on-demand, multimedia, and Internet access, that transfer large volumes of information to subscriber 12 in response to\n",
      "shorter requests for information.  In one specific embodiment, downlink data rate 32 is approximately 1.5 Mbps, whereas uplink data rate 34 is approximately 750 kbps.  In other embodiments, downlink data rate 32 may be six Mbps or more depending on the\n",
      "specific XDSL technology employed, the quality and length of subscriber line 16, and the contribution of noise and distortion from other components in communication system 10.\n",
      "<br/><br/>XDSL technology provides data service using existing subscriber lines 16 without interrupting normal telephone service.  This is accomplished by a separation technique, such as frequency division multiplexing (FDM), to separate frequencies that\n",
      "provide telephone service from those frequencies that provide data service.  Dynamic noise cancellation techniques and a guard band between the data and phone service frequencies ensure reliable and simultaneous access to data and phone service over\n",
      "subscriber line 16.  For example, subscriber 12 may simultaneously engage in both a data communication session using computer 22 and a voice conversation using telephone 20.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, communication system 10 provides phone and data service to subscriber 12.  Subscriber 12 accesses phone service by using telephone 20 to initiate a call.  Upon going off-hook, communication system 10 establishes a circuit between\n",
      "telephone 20 and telephone switch 56 using interface 24, phone line 26, splitter 25, subscriber line 16, splitter 50, and one of phone lines 52.  Upon establishing this telephone circuit, subscriber 12 using telephone 20 receives POTS service from\n",
      "telephone switch 56.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To access data service, subscriber 12 turns on computer 22, executes a program, such as an Internet browser, or performs some other affirmative or passive activity that generates a request, command, data packet, electrical tone, or other suitable\n",
      "information or signal that indicates a need for data service.  In one embodiment, modem 30 repetitively transmits the need for data service in a request interval, where the request interval comprises the time length of the request and the silent interval\n",
      "until the next request.  Alternatively, the need for data service indicated at subscriber 12 may be based on the establishment of a closed circuit between subscriber 12 and central office 14 or on one or more analog or digital signal transitions.  Modem\n",
      "30 communicates the need to communication server 58 at central office 14 using interface 24, data line 28, splitter 25, subscriber line 16, splitter 50, and one of data lines 54.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As described in detail below, communication server 58 detects the need for data service and selects an XDSL modem at communication server 58 to communicate with XDSL modem 30 in computer 22.  Upon establishing a modem connection between modem 30\n",
      "in computer 22 and a selected modem in communication server 58, subscriber 12 engages in a data communication session with communication network 64 using network device 60.  In addition, computer 22 may function as a gateway into communication network 10\n",
      "for other devices coupled to network interface 31 using link 18.\n",
      "<br/><br/>XDSL technology allows simultaneous use of subscriber line 16 for both phone and data service using the existing twisted pair wiring in communication system 10.  In one embodiment, splitter 50, communication server 58, and network device 60 are\n",

      "<br/><br/>This invention relates in general to data communication, and more particularly to a communication server apparatus using digital signal switching and method.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>A communication server provides access to communication facilities.  For example, a communication server having a bank of modems may provide subscriber access to the modems for data communication.  A communication server may be associated with\n",
      "its own dedicated communication network, or with an existing communication network, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN).\n",
      "<br/><br/>As communication networks provide greater connectivity and access to information, there is an increasing demand for data communication at higher rates.  One solution to provide increased data rates replaces existing twisted pair wiring with high\n",
      "bandwidth media, such as coaxial cables or fiber optic links.  Other solutions adopt improved communication techniques using the existing hardware infrastructure.  For example, digital subscriber line (XDSL) technology provides higher bandwidth data\n",
      "service over existing twisted pair wiring.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To deliver data service to the subscriber, a communication server may provide a dedicated or permanent connection to its communication facilities.  For example, an existing communication server at a central office provides enough communication\n",
      "facilities to simultaneously service all PSTN subscribers.  However, all telephone subscribers may not desire data service.  Furthermore, the subscribers that desire data service may not simultaneously access the communication server.\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>In accordance with the present invention, the disadvantages and problems associated with communication servers have been substantially reduced or eliminated.  In particular, a communication server apparatus using digital signal switching and a\n",
      "method are disclosed that provide data service to a number of subscribers using a reduced number of XDSL communication facilities.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a communication server includes a plurality of line interface components and detectors.  Each line interface components and detector is coupled to an associated twisted pair data line.  The\n",
      "line interface components and detectors operate to detect a need for data service on the twisted pair data line and to provide a signal indicating a request for service.  The communication server also includes a plurality of analog/digital and\n",
      "digital/analog converters.  Each analog/digital and digital/analog converter is coupled to an associated line interface components and detector.  A plurality of parallel/serial and serial/parallel converters are each coupled to an associated\n",
      "analog/digital and digital/analog converter.  The communication server further includes a plurality of XDSL modems.  A digital multiplexer is coupled to the parallel/serial and serial/parallel converters and coupled to the XDSL modems.  The digital\n",
      "multiplexer operates to couple a selected subset of the parallel/serial and serial/parallel converters to the XDSL modems.  A controller is coupled to the detector and to the digital multiplexer.  The controller operates to select one of the XDSL modems\n",
      "in response to detecting the need for data service and further operates to direct the digital multiplexer to couple the selected XDSL modem to the parallel/serial and serial/parallel converter associated with the detected need for data service.\n",
      "<br/><br/>According to another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for coupling a selected subset of a plurality of twisted pair subscriber lines to a plurality of XDSL modems.  Each twisted pair subscriber line is split into a twisted\n",
      "pair data line and a twisted pair phone line.  Analog signals received on the twisted pair data lines are converted into incoming parallel digital words and outgoing parallel digital words are converted into analog signals for transmission on the twisted\n",
      "pair data lines using first converters coupled to each twisted pair data line.  The incoming parallel digital words are converted into incoming serial bit streams and outgoing serial bit streams are converted into the outgoing parallel digital words\n",
      "using second converters coupled to the first converters.  A need for data service is detected on a selected twisted pair data line, and one of the XDSL modems is selected in response to detecting the need for data service.  The selected XDSL modem is\n",
      "then coupled to a second converter associated with the selected twisted pair data line where the selected XDSL modem receives the incoming serial bit stream from and provides the outgoing serial bit stream to the associated second converter.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Important technical advantages of the present invention include a communication server that provides data service to a number of subscribers using a reduced number of XDSL communication facilities.  Over-subscription of data service is\n",
      "accomplished by selectively coupling a number of twisted pair data lines to a reduced number of XDSL modems.  A controller polls the data lines in succession to determine which subscribers of the communication system need data service.  Upon detecting a\n",
      "need for data service on a selected data line, the controller directs a switch to couple the selected data line to an available modem.  The communication server may then provide data service suitable for high bandwidth applications, such as\n",
      "video-on-demand, multimedia, or Internet access.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another important technical advantage of the present invention includes a communication server that provides over-subscribed XDSL data service using the existing infrastructure of the public switched telephone network (PSTN).  Asymmetric digital\n",
      "subscriber line (ADSL), symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL), high-speed digital subscriber line (HDSL), very high-speed digital subscriber line (VDSL), or other suitable XDSL technology can provide higher bandwidth data service over existing twisted\n",
      "pair wiring.  These technologies may support data service simultaneously with traditional telephone service using a separation technique, such as frequency division multiplexing.  In one embodiment, a splitter divides each incoming twisted pair\n",
      "subscriber line into a twisted pair phone line and a twisted pair data line.  The phone line is coupled to a telephone switch to provide telephone service and the data line is coupled to the communication server to provide over-subscribed XDSL data\n",
      "service.  The communication server and splitter may be located at a central office of the PSTN.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another important technical advantage of the present invention includes the management and monitoring of XDSL data service provided to subscribers.  To accomplish this, the communication server maintains an activity table to determine status\n",
      "information on twisted pair data lines and XDSL modems.  In addition, the communication server can track subscriber usage, monitor subscriber information and generate billing and demographic information.  In a particular embodiment, an activity detector\n",
      "disconnects a subscriber after a predetermined period of inactivity to release a modem for use by another subscriber.\n",
      "<br/><br/>An additional important technical advantage of the present invention includes switching the connections between data lines and the XDSL.sup.5 modems using digital signals and switching.  The digital switching can allow better performance for high\n",
      "frequency signals.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another important technical advantage of the present invention is the distribution of the switching function to allow scalability of the number of supported data lines and over-subscription of XDSL modems.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A further important technical advantage of the present invention includes using digital signals and switching to make the connections between data lines and XDSL modems.  The digital switching can allow the use of digital signal processors to\n",
      "implement modems in the modem pool and can allow better performance for high frequency signals.  Other important technical advantages are readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims. <br/><br/>BRIEF\n",

      "<br/><br/>FIG. 1 illustrates a communication system 10 that provides both telephone and data service to a subscriber 12.  A central office 14 is coupled to subscriber 12 using subscriber line 16.  In operation, central office 14 provides telephone and data\n",
      "service to subscriber 12 using subscriber line 16.  Subscriber line 16 supports simultaneous telephone and data service using twisted pair wiring.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Subscriber 12 includes a telephone 20 and a computer 22, both coupled to an interface 24.  A splitter 25 is coupled to subscriber line 16 and operates to split subscriber line 16 into a twisted pair phone line 26 and a twisted pair data line 28. \n",
      "Phone line 26 is coupled to telephone 20 using interface 24.  Similarly, data line 28 is coupled to computer 22 using interface 24.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Subscriber 12 refers to one or more components at the subscriber premises shown in FIG. 1, as well as the user of these components.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Telephone 20 is a traditional telephone transceiver, a cordless telephone transceiver, or any other device suitable for allowing communication over telephone line 26.  Computer 22 comprises a mainframe device, mini-frame device, server, desktop\n",
      "personal computer, notebook personal computer, or other suitable computing device having an XDSL modem 30 that communicates data using data line 28.  Modem 30 couples to other components of computer 22 using a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus,\n",
      "an Industrial Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, a Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) interface, or any other suitable technology that provides input/output capability to computer 22.  The selection and design of modem 30 for\n",
      "computer 22 may.  depend on the type or functionality of computer 22, as well as the data service rate supported by data line 28.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Modem 30 transmits and receives data in communication system 10 using any suitable digital subscriber line technology, referred to generally as XDSL.  Modem 30 also supports Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, V.35 data protocol, frame relay, asynchronous\n",
      "transfer mode (ATM), switched multi-megabit data service (SMDS), high-level data link control (HDLC), serial line Internet protocol (SLIP), point-to-point protocol (PPP), transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), or any other appropriate\n",
      "protocol, collectively referred to as digital protocol.  For example, computer 22 may include a network interface 31 to receive data from central office 14 or to further communicate data to a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or other\n",
      "suitable network coupled to computer 22 using link 18.  In general, modem 30 translates information between the communication protocol supported by communication system 10 and the digital protocol supported by computer 22.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Communication system 10 includes numerous other twisted pair subscriber lines 16 coupled to other subscribers 12.  In an exemplary embodiment, central office 14 provides phone and data service to one thousand subscribers, with each subscriber 12\n",
      "including one or more components described above at its premises.  The subscribers and subscriber lines in communication system 10 are referred to collectively in the plural as subscribers 12 and subscriber lines 16.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Interface 24 couples phone line 26 to telephone 20, and data line 28 to computer 22.  In one embodiment, interface 24 provides additional couplings to additional telephones 20 and computers 22 at subscriber 12.  Splitter 25 is a passive or active\n",
      "splitter that divides subscriber line 16 into phone line 26 and data line 28 of the same type.  Throughout this description, phone line 26 and data line 28 may be referred to specifically, or collectively as part of subscriber line 16.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Subscriber line 16 couples subscriber 12 to central office 14.  Subscriber line 16 comprises twisted pair wiring that is commonly installed at subscriber premises and as the local loop in many public switched telephone networks (PSTNs). \n",
      "Subscriber line 16 may be unshielded twisted pair (UTP), shielded twisted pair (STP), or other suitable type or category of twisted pair wiring made of copper or other suitable material.  Phone line 26 and data line 28 associated with subscriber line 16\n",
      "may be the same or different type or category of twisted pair wiring.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Central office 14 includes a splitter 50 coupled to subscriber line 16.  Like splitter 25 at subscriber 12, splitter 50 at central office 14 is a passive or active splitter that divides subscriber line 16 into a twisted pair phone line 52 and a\n",
      "twisted pair data line 54.  Phone line 52 and data line 54 associated with subscriber line 16 may be the same or different type or category of twisted pair wiring.  A telephone switch 56 at central office 14 is coupled to phone line 52 to provide plain\n",
      "old telephone system (POTS) service to subscriber 12.  Telephone switch 56 also represents other components in the PSTN or other suitable voice communication network, such as switches, wireline or wireless links, satellites, microwave uplinks, and other\n",
      "communication facilities to deliver telephone service to subscriber 12.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A communication server 58 is coupled to splitter 50 using data line 54.  As described in detail below, communication server 58 manages the provisioning of data service to subscriber 12.  Communication server 58 performs off-hook detection to\n",
      "determine if subscriber 12 desires data service.  Specifically, communication server 58 couples a modem to subscriber line 16 upon detecting a need for data service from computer 22.  Communication server 58 tracks subscriber usage, monitors subscriber\n",
      "information, and generates billing and demographic information, as described below.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The data off-hook detector in communication server 58 can use one of several methods to determine whether subscriber 12 should be connected to an XDSL modem.  The off-hook detector may monitor direct current voltages, electrical tones, data link\n",
      "frames, or any other protocol or data sequencing to determine whether subscriber 12 needs data access.  The off-hook detector in communication server 58 may monitor electrical tones generated by modem 30 while in the process of training, notching,\n",
      "equalizing, or performing any other task that puts electrical tones onto subscriber line 16 and its associated data line 54.  Communication server 58 may also detect frames or packets.  These frames or packets could be Ethernet, ATM, HDLC, or any\n",
      "suitable data communications frame format.  The off-hook detector in communication server 58 could also examine various protocols such as TCP/IP, PPP, or any other suitable network protocol or data stream.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Communications server 58 multiplexes modem digital outputs into a multiplexed digital line 62 for delivery to a router or other network device 60.  In one embodiment, multiplexed digital line 62 carries a single bidirectional and multiplexed\n",
      "signal for all subscribers 12 in communication system 10.  Signals on multiplexed digital line 62 may support any appropriate digital protocol use by network device 60.  A communication network 64, such as a global communication network like the\n",
      "Internet, is coupled to network device 60.  Communication network 64 may also include a synchronous optical network (SONET), a frame relay network, an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network, a T1, T3, E1, or E3 network, or any other suitable\n",
      "communication network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>One important technical advantage of the present invention is the ability to over-subscribe the XDSL communication facilities of communication server 58 to service an increasing number of subscribers 12 in communication system 10.  Communication\n",
      "server 58 may couple to the same number and type of data lines 54 as represented by subscriber lines 16 in communication system 10.  For example, if central office 14 services one thousand subscribers 12 using twisted pair subscriber lines 16, then data\n",
      "lines 54 coupled to communication server 58 may represent as many as one thousand twisted pair lines.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In one embodiment, not all subscribers 12 in communication system 10 desire access to data service provided by communication server 58.  Splitter 50 need not provide a separate data line 54 for those subscribers 12 that only desire phone service\n",
      "from telephone switch 56.  As more subscribers 12 desire access to data service, the XDSL communication capabilities of splitter 50 and communication server 58 may be supplemented in a modular and cost effective manner to meet the demand.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Communication system 10 supports data service over subscriber lines 16 using asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL), high-speed digital subscriber line (HDSL), very high-speed digital subscriber line\n",
      "(VDSL), or any other suitable technology that allows high rate data service over twisted pair wiring.  All of these technologies are referred to collectively as XDSL or communication protocol.  In one embodiment, subscriber line 16 and components of\n",
      "subscriber 12 and central office 14 support communication using ADSL techniques that comply with ANSI standard T1.413.  In another embodiment, ADSL communication over subscriber line 16 may be performed using the carrier-less amplitude phase modulation\n",
      "(CAP) technique developed by AT&amp;T Corporation.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In an ADSL communication system, the downlink data rate 32 from central office 14 to subscriber 12 is greater than the uplink data rate 34 from subscriber 12 to central office 14.  This allows high bandwidth communication to subscriber 12, while\n",
      "still providing lower bandwidth communication to central office 14.  ADSL communication is well-adapted for applications, such as video-on-demand, multimedia, and Internet access, that transfer large volumes of information to subscriber 12 in response to\n",
      "shorter requests for information.  In one specific embodiment, downlink data rate 32 is approximately 1.5 Mbps, whereas uplink data rate 34 is approximately 750 kbps.  In other embodiments, downlink data rate 32 may be six Mbps or more depending on the\n",
      "specific XDSL technology employed, the quality and length of subscriber line 16, and the contribution of noise and distortion from other components in communication system 10.\n",
      "<br/><br/>XDSL technology provides data service using existing subscriber lines 16 without interrupting normal telephone service.  This is accomplished by a separation technique, such as frequency division multiplexing (FDM), to separate frequencies that\n",
      "provide telephone service from those frequencies that provide data service.  Dynamic noise cancellation techniques and a guard band between the data and phone service frequencies ensure reliable and simultaneous access to data and phone service over\n",
      "subscriber line 16.  For example, subscriber 12 may simultaneously engage in both a data communication session using computer 22 and a voice conversation using telephone 20.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, communication system 10 provides phone and data service to subscriber 12.  Subscriber 12 accesses phone service by using telephone 20 to initiate a call.  Upon going off-hook, communication system 10 establishes a circuit between\n",
      "telephone 20 and telephone switch 56 using interface 24, phone line 26, splitter 25, subscriber line 16, splitter 50, and one of phone lines 52.  Upon establishing this telephone circuit, subscriber 12 using telephone 20 receives POTS service from\n",
      "telephone switch 56.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To access data service, subscriber 12 turns on computer 22., executes a program, such as an Internet browser, or performs some other affirmative or passive activity that generates a request, command, data packet, electrical tone, or other\n",
      "suitable information or signal that indicates a need for data service.  In one embodiment, modem 30 repetitively transmits the need for data service in a request interval, where the request interval comprises the time length of the request and the silent\n",
      "interval until the next request.  Alternatively, the need for data service indicated at subscriber 12 may be based on the establishment of a closed circuit between subscriber 12 and central office 14 or on one or more analog or digital signal\n",
      "transitions.  Modem 30 communicates the need to communication server 58 at central office 14 using interface 24, data line 28, splitter 25, subscriber line 16, splitter 50, and one of data lines 54.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As described in detail below, communication server 58 detects the need for data service and selects an XDSL modem at communication server 58 to communicate with XDSL modem 30 in computer 22.  Upon establishing a modem connection between modem 30\n",
      "in computer 22 and a selected modem in communication server 58, subscriber 12 engages in a data communication session with communication network 64 using network device 60.  In addition, computer 22 may function as a gateway into communication network 10\n",
      "for other devices coupled to network interface 31 using link 18.\n",
      "<br/><br/>XDSL technology allows simultaneous use of subscriber line 16 for both phone and data service using the existing twisted pair wiring in communication system 10.  In one embodiment, splitter 50, communication server 58, and network device 60 are\n",
      "located at central office 14 to provide an efficient and modular provisioning of XDSL data service to subscribers 12.  However, splitter 50, communication server 58, and network device 60 may be located outside central office 14 without departing from\n",

      "INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>This invention relates in general to data communication, and more particularly to a communication server apparatus having a four-wire switching interface and method.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>A communication server provides access to communication facilities.  For example, a communication server having a bank of modems may provide subscriber access to the modems for data communication.  A communication server may be associated with\n",
      "its own dedicated communication network, or with an existing communication network, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN).\n",
      "<br/><br/>As communication networks provide greater connectivity and access to information, there is an increasing demand for data communication at higher rates.  One solution to provide increased data rates replaces existing twisted pair wiring with high\n",
      "bandwidth media, such as coaxial cables or fiber optic links.  Other solutions adopt improved communication techniques using the existing hardware infrastructure.  For example, digital subscriber line (XDSL) technology provides higher bandwidth data\n",
      "service over existing twisted pair wiring.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To deliver data service to the subscriber, a communication server may provide a dedicated or permanent connection to its communication facilities.  For example, an existing communication server at a central office provides enough communication\n",
      "facilities to simultaneously service all PSTN subscribers.  However, all telephone subscribers may not desire data service.  Furthermore, the subscribers that desire data service may not simultaneously access the communication server.\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>In accordance with the present invention, the disadvantages and problems associated with communication servers have been substantially reduced or eliminated.  In particular, a communication server apparatus having a four-wire switching interface\n",
      "and method are disclosed that provide data service to a number of subscribers using a reduced number of XDSL communication facilities.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a communication server is provided that includes a plurality of line interface units.  Each line interface unit is coupled to an associated twisted pair data line and coupled to an\n",
      "associated receive data pair and transmit data pair.  The communication server also includes a plurality of XDSL modems coupled to associated modem receive data pairs and transmit data pairs.  A switch is coupled to the receive data pair and transmit\n",
      "data pair of each line interface unit and is also coupled to the modem receive data pair and transmit data pair of each XDSL modem.  The switch operates to couple a selected subset of the receive data pairs and transmit data pairs of the line interface\n",
      "units to the modem receive data pairs and transmit data pairs of the XDSL modems.  A detector is operable to detect a need for data service on a receive data pair of a selected line interface unit.  A controller is coupled to the detector and to the\n",
      "switch.  The controller operates to select one of the XDSL modems in response to detecting the need for data service and further operates to direct the switch to couple the receive data pair and transmit data pair of the selected line interface unit to\n",
      "the modem receive data pair and transmit data pair of the selected XDSL modem.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for coupling a selected subset of a plurality of twisted pair subscriber lines to a plurality of XDSL modems.  Each twisted pair subscriber line is split into a\n",
      "twisted pair data line and a twisted pair phone line.  Each twisted pair data line is separated into an associated receive data pair and transmit data pair.  A need for data service is detected on a selected receive data pair.  One of the XDSL modems is\n",
      "selected in response to detecting the need for data service.  The selected receive data pair and associated transmit data pair are then coupled to a modem receive data pair and transmit data pair of the selected XDSL modem.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Important technical advantages of the present invention include a communication server that provides data service to a number of subscribers using a reduced number of XDSL communication facilities.  Over-subscription of data service is\n",
      "accomplished by selectively coupling a number of twisted pair data lines to a reduced number of XDSL modems.  A controller polls the data lines in succession to determine which subscribers of the communication system need data service.  Upon detecting a\n",
      "need for data service on a selected data line, the controller directs a switch to couple the selected data line to an available modem.  The communication server may then provide data service suitable for high bandwidth applications, such as\n",
      "video-on-demand, multimedia, or Internet access.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another important technical advantage of the present invention includes a communication server that provides over-subscribed XDSL data service using the existing infrastructure of the public switched telephone network (PSTN).  Asymmetric digital\n",
      "subscriber line (ADSL), symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL), high-speed digital subscriber line (HDSL), very high-speed digital subscriber line (VDSL), or other suitable XDSL technology can provide higher bandwidth data service over existing twisted\n",
      "pair wiring.  These technologies may support data service simultaneously with traditional telephone service using a separation technique, such as frequency division multiplexing.  In one embodiment, a splitter divides each incoming twisted pair\n",
      "subscriber line into a twisted pair phone line and a twisted pair data line.  The phone line is coupled to a telephone switch to provide telephone service and the data line is coupled to the communication server to provide over-subscribed XDSL data\n",
      "service.  The communication server and splitter may be located at a central office of the PSTN.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another important technical advantage of the present invention includes the management and monitoring of XDSL data service provided to subscribers.  To accomplish this, the communication server maintains an activity table to determine status\n",
      "information on twisted pair data lines and XDSL modems.  In addition, the communication server can track subscriber usage, monitor subscriber information and generate billing and demographic information.  In a particular embodiment, an activity detector\n",
      "disconnects a subscriber after a predetermined period of inactivity to release a modem for use by another subscriber.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A further important technical advantage of the present invention includes isolating the switch from the data lines and subscriber lines.  The switch can thereby operate without constraints imposed by technical requirements for interaction with\n",
      "the data lines and subscriber lines.  For example, isolation of the switching matrix allows CMOS switches to be used rather than more expensive solid state relays or mechanical relays.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another important technical advantage of the present invention is the distribution of the switching function to allow scalability of the number of supported data lines and over-subscription of XDSL modems.  Other important technical advantages\n",
      "are readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n",

      "<br/><br/>FIG. 1 illustrates a communication system 10 that provides both telephone and data service to a subscriber 12.  A central office 14 is coupled to subscriber 12 using subscriber line 16.  In operation, central office 14 provides telephone and data\n",
      "service to subscriber 12 using subscriber line 16.  Subscriber line 16 supports simultaneous telephone and data service using twisted pair wiring.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Subscriber 12 includes a telephone 20 and a computer 22, both coupled to an interface 24.  A splitter 25 is coupled to subscriber line 16 and operates to split subscriber line 16 into a twisted pair phone line 26 and a twisted pair data line 28. \n",
      "Phone line 26 is coupled to telephone 20 using interface 24.  Similarly, data line 28 is coupled to computer 22 using interface 24.  Subscriber 12 refers to one or more components at the subscriber premises shown in FIG. 1, as well as the user of these\n",
      "components.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Telephone 20 is a traditional telephone transceiver, a cordless telephone transceiver, or any other device suitable for allowing communication over telephone line 26.  Computer 22 comprises a mainframe device, mini-frame device, server, desktop\n",
      "personal computer, notebook personal computer, or other suitable computing device having an XDSL modem 30 that communicates data using data line 28.  Modem 30 couples to other components of computer 22 using a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus,\n",
      "an Industrial Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, a Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) interface, or any other suitable technology that provides input/output capability to computer 22.  The selection and design of modem 30 for\n",
      "computer 22 may depend on the type or functionality of computer 22, as well as the data service rate supported by data line 28.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Modem 30 transmits and receives data in communication system 10 using any suitable digital subscriber line technology, referred to generally as XDSL.  Modem 30 also supports Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, V.35 data protocol, frame relay, asynchronous\n",
      "transfer mode (ATM), switched multi-megabit data service (SMDS), high-level data link control (HDLC), serial line Internet protocol (SLIP), point-to-point protocol (PPP), transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), or any other appropriate\n",
      "protocol, collectively referred to as digital protocol.  For example, computer 22 may include a network interface 31 to receive data from central office 14 or to further communicate data to a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or other\n",
      "suitable network coupled to computer 22 using link 18.  In general, modem 30 translates information between the communication protocol supported by communication system 10 and the digital protocol supported by computer 22.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Communication system 10 includes numerous other twisted pair subscriber lines 16 coupled to other subscribers 12.  In an exemplary embodiment, central office 14 provides phone and data service to one thousand subscribers, with each subscriber 12\n",
      "including one or more components described above at its premises.  The subscribers and subscriber lines in communication system 10 are referred to collectively in the plural as subscribers 12 and subscriber lines 16.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Interface 24 couples phone line 26 to telephone 20, and data line 28 to computer 22.  In one embodiment, interface 24 provides additional couplings to additional telephones 20 and computers 22 at subscriber 12.  Splitter 25 is a passive or active\n",
      "splitter that divides subscriber line 16 into phone line 26 and data line 28 of the same type.  Throughout this description, phone line 26 and data line 28 may be referred to specifically, or collectively as part of subscriber line 16.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Subscriber line 16 couples subscriber 12 to central office 14.  Subscriber line 16 comprises twisted pair wiring that is commonly installed at subscriber premises and as the local loop in many public switched telephone networks (PSTNs). \n",
      "Subscriber line 16 may be unshielded twisted pair (UTP), shielded twisted pair (STP), or other suitable type or category of twisted pair wiring made of copper or other suitable material.  Phone line 26 and data line 28 associated with subscriber line 16\n",
      "may be the same or different type or category of twisted pair wiring.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Central office 14 includes a splitter 50 coupled to subscriber line 16.  Like splitter 25 at subscriber 12, splitter 50 at central office 14 is a passive or active splitter that divides subscriber line 16 into a twisted pair phone line 52 and a\n",
      "twisted pair data line 54.  Phone line 52 and data line 54 associated with subscriber line 16 may be the same or different type or category of twisted pair wiring.  A telephone switch 56 at central office 14 is coupled to phone line 52 to provide plain\n",
      "old telephone system (POTS) service to subscriber 12.  Telephone switch 56 also represents other components in the PSTN or other suitable voice communication network, such as switches, wireline or wireless links, satellites, microwave uplinks, and other\n",
      "communication facilities to deliver telephone service to subscriber 12.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A communication server 58 is coupled to splitter 50 using data line 54.  As described in detail below, communication server 58 manages the provisioning of data service to subscriber 12.  Communication server 58 performs off-hook detection to\n",
      "determine if subscriber 12 desires data service.  Specifically, communication server 58 couples a modem to subscriber line 16 upon detecting a need for data service from computer 22.  Communication server 58 tracks subscriber usage, monitors subscriber\n",
      "information, and generates billing and demographic information, as described below.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The data off-hook detector in communication server 58 can use one of several methods to determine whether subscriber 12 should be connected to an XDSL modem.  The off-hook detector may monitor direct current voltages, electrical tones, data link\n",
      "frames, or any other protocol or data sequencing to determine whether subscriber 12 needs data access.  The off-hook detector in communication server 58 may monitor electrical tones generated by modem 30 while in the process of training, notching,\n",
      "equalizing, or performing any other task that puts electrical tones onto subscriber line 16 and its associated data line 54.  Communication server 58 may also detect frames or packets.  These frames or packets could be Ethernet, ATM, HDLC, or any\n",
      "suitable data communications frame format.  The off-hook detector in communication server 58 could also examine various protocols such as TCP/IP, PPP, or any other suitable network protocol or data stream.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Communications server 58 multiplexes modem digital outputs into a multiplexed digital line 62 for delivery to a router or other network device 60.  In one embodiment, multiplexed digital line 62 carries a single bidirectional and multiplexed\n",
      "signal for all subscribers 12 in communication system 10.  Signals on multiplexed digital line 62 may support any appropriate digital protocol used by network device 60.  A communication network 64, such as a global communication network like the\n",
      "Internet, is coupled to network device 60.  Communication network 64 may also include a synchronous optical network (SONET), a frame relay network, an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network, a T1, T3, E1, or E3 network, or any other suitable\n",
      "communication network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>One important technical advantage of the present invention is the ability to over-subscribe the XDSL communication facilities of communication server 58 to service an increasing number of subscribers 12 in communication system 10.  Communication\n",
      "server 58 may couple to the same number and type of data lines 54 as represented by subscriber lines 16 in communication system 10.  For example, if central office 14 services one thousand subscribers 12 using twisted pair subscriber lines 16, then data\n",
      "lines 54 coupled to communication server 58 may represent as many as one thousand twisted pair lines.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In one embodiment, not all subscribers 12 in communication system 10 desire access to data service provided by communication server 58.  Splitter 50 need not provide a separate data line 54 for those subscribers 12 that only desire phone service\n",
      "from telephone switch 56.  As more subscribers 12 desire access to data service, the XDSL communication capabilities of splitter 50 and communication server 58 may be supplemented in a modular and cost effective manner to meet the demand.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Communication system 10 supports data service over subscriber lines 16 using asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL), high-speed digital subscriber line (HDSL), very high-speed digital subscriber line\n",
      "(VDSL), or any other suitable technology that allows high rate data service over twisted pair wiring.  All of these technologies are referred to collectively as XDSL or communication protocol.  In one embodiment, subscriber line 16 and components of\n",
      "subscriber 12 and central office 14 support communication using ADSL techniques that comply with ANSI standard T1.413.  In another embodiment, ADSL communication over subscriber line 16 may be performed using the carrier-less amplitude phase modulation\n",
      "(CAP) technique developed by AT&amp;T Corporation.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In an ADSL communication system, the downlink data rate 32 from central office 14 to subscriber 12 is greater than the uplink data rate 34 from subscriber 12 to central office 14.  This allows high bandwidth communication to subscriber 12, while\n",
      "still providing lower bandwidth communication to central office 14.  ADSL communication is well-adapted for applications, such as video-on-demand, multimedia, and Internet access, that transfer large volumes of information to subscriber 12 in response to\n",
      "shorter requests for information.  In one specific embodiment, downlink data rate 32 is approximately 1.5 Mbps, whereas uplink data rate 34 is approximately 750 kbps.  In other embodiments, downlink data rate 32 may be six Mbps or more depending on the\n",
      "specific XDSL technology employed, the quality and length of subscriber line 16, and the contribution of noise and distortion from other components in communication system 10.\n",
      "<br/><br/>XDSL technology provides data service using existing subscriber lines 16 without interrupting normal telephone service.  This is accomplished by a separation technique, such as frequency division multiplexing (FDM), to separate frequencies that\n",
      "provide telephone service from those frequencies that provide data service.  Dynamic noise cancellation techniques and a guard band between the data and phone service frequencies ensure reliable and simultaneous access to data and phone service over\n",
      "subscriber line 16.  For example, subscriber 12 may simultaneously engage in both a data communication session using computer 22 and a voice conversation using telephone 20.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, communication system 10 provides phone and data service to subscriber 12.  Subscriber 12 accesses phone service by using telephone 20 to initiate a call.  Upon going off-hook, communication system 10 establishes a circuit between\n",
      "telephone 20 and telephone switch 56 using interface 24, phone line 26, splitter 25, subscriber line 16, splitter 50, and one of phone lines 52.  Upon establishing this telephone circuit, subscriber 12 using telephone 20 receives POTS service from\n",
      "telephone switch 56.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To access data service, subscriber 12 turns on computer 22, executes a program, such as an Internet browser, or performs some other affirmative or passive activity that generates a request, command, data packet, electrical tone, or other suitable\n",
      "information or signal that indicates a need for data service.  In one embodiment, modem 30 repetitively transmits the need for data service in a request interval, where the request interval comprises the time length of the request and the silent interval\n",
      "until the next request.  Alternatively, the need for data service indicated at subscriber 12 may be based on the establishment of a closed circuit between subscriber 12 and central office 14 or on one or more analog or digital signal transitions.  Modem\n",
      "30 communicates the need to communication server 58 at central office 14 using interface 24, data line 28, splitter 25, subscriber line 16, splitter 50, and one of data lines 54.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As described in detail below, communication server 58 detects the need for data service and selects an XDSL modem at communication server 58 to communicate with XDSL modem 30 in computer 22.  Upon establishing a modem connection between modem 30\n",
      "in computer 22 and a selected modem in communication server 58, subscriber 12 engages in a data communication session with communication network 64 using network device 60.  In addition, computer 22 may function as a gateway into communication network 10\n",
      "for other devices coupled to network interface 31 using link 18.\n",
      "<br/><br/>XDSL technology allows simultaneous use of subscriber line 16 for both phone and data service using the existing twisted pair wiring in communication system 10.  In one embodiment, splitter 50, communication server 58, and network device 60 are\n",
      "located at central office 14 to provide an efficient and modular provisioning of XDST data service to subscribers 12.  However, splitter 50, communication server 58, and network device 60 may be located outside central office 14 without departing from\n",

      "<br/><br/>Modems in modem pool 74 convert signals in an appropriate XDSL communication protocol into digital data in an appropriate digital protocol on digital lines 76.  A multiplexer 78 is coupled to digital lines 76 and combines the signals on digital\n",

      "<br/><br/>A controller 80 is coupled to data lines 54 using a link 82.  Controller 80 is also coupled to switch 70 and modem pool 74 using links 84 and 86, respectively.  Controller 80 detects a need for data service generated by subscribers 12 and\n",
      "communicated over subscriber lines 16 to data lines 54.  In response, controller 80 using link 84 directs switch 70 to couple a selected subset of data lines 54 to selected output lines 72 that couple to modems in modem pool 74.  For example, controller\n",
      "80 may monitor one thousand data lines 54 to provide XDSL data services using one hundred modems in modem pool 74.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Controller 80 also receives information from modem pool 74 using link 86 to determine status information of modems in modem pool 74.  As digital lines 76 become inactive for a predetermined period of time, modem pool 74 detects this inactivity\n",
      "and generates a timeout indication for communication to controller 80.  Upon receiving the timeout indication, controller 80 releases the inactive modem in modem pool 74 for later use.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, communication server 58 detects a need for data service on a selected data line 54.  This need may be indicated by current voltages, electrical tones, data link frames, packets, or any other suitable analog or digital protocol or\n",

      "<br/><br/>This invention relates in general to the field of electronic circuits and devices and, more particularly, to a low distortion compensated field effect transistor (FET) switch.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>In general, a field effect transistor (FET) switch functions by receiving a control (or gate) bias which is sufficient to cause the FET channel to conduct in an \"on\" state and not to conduct in an \"off\" state.  Such switches can be constructed,\n",
      "for example, using metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), junction field effect transistors (JFETs) and metal-semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs).  In operation, with no gate bias with respect to the source and drain\n",
      "of the FET, the channel of the FET does not conduct as the channel is depleted of carriers.  In the case of an n-channel device, for example, this means that there are no excess electrons to facilitate the transport of a current.  For an n-channel\n",
      "device, a positive potential with respect to the channel (at source and drain potential) can be applied to the gate, and the channel carriers (e.g., electrons) are enhanced.  The channel resistivity is modulated by the magnitude of the difference between\n",
      "the source and drain potential and the controlling gate potential.  The greater the difference, the more the conductivity of the channel is enhanced up to a value determined by the doping density of the N-type channel semiconductor.\n",
      "<br/><br/>An FET switch can be used in discrete and integrated circuits as voltage controlled switches either connecting or disconnecting the source from the drain of the FET device.  For example, a signal to be switched can be connected to the source, and\n",
      "a fixed bias potential can be placed on the gate to control the connection.  (It should be noted that, in a device that is axially symmetrical, the designation of source and drain is arbitrary.) In the case of a time-varying signal, as the voltage\n",
      "magnitude of the signal applied to the source varies, it varies the bias potential difference between the source and the gate.  This modulates the resistance of the channel between the source and drain.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Placing a resistive load from the drain to signal ground will cause a current to flow through the FET channel.  However, as the channel resistance is modulated by the applied source signal, a wave form that is not an exact duplicate of the\n",
      "applied signal wave form can appear across the load resistor.  The result is an output wave form that contains intermodulation products of the input signal.  This distortion limits the dynamic range of the signal passing through the FET switch and hence\n",
      "limits the amount of information that can be switched through the FET switch device.  Typically, such distortion caused by channel conductivity modulation is greater in metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices than in junction devices because the complex\n",
      "nature of the gate oxide produces a high order of non-linearity.  In the JFET, the conductivity approximates a squared function of the applied gate-source voltage.  However, in the MOSFET, this relation contains higher order non-linearities as evidenced\n",
      "in a Voltera series of its transfer function.  This causes even relatively narrow band signals to be distorted by third, fifth and seventh order intermodulation products.\n",
      "<br/><br/>There are conventional methods for decreasing distortion in the output waveform of a switch that involve paralleling N-channel and P-channel devices.  For example, a single N-channel FET can be used as a switch, but as the channel to gate voltage\n",
      "decreases with increased input voltage, the channel resistance will increase due to decreased carrier enhancement.  A P-channel FET, requiring a negative gate bias to turn the channel \"on\", displays the same behavior with the resistance increase\n",
      "occurring with an increased negative input voltage.  The paralleling of an N-channel and a P-channel device can decrease the resistance curvature about zero volts, and thus decrease the distortion in the output waveform of the switch.  This paralleling\n",
      "can result in reducing the slope of the resistance versus input voltage to approximately zero thus minimizing the distortion in the voltage range around zero.  However, compensation of the resistance curve over a wide range of input voltages is not\n",
      "possible with such a design.\n",
      "<br/><br/>It would be advantageous to provide a low distortion field effect transistor switch which allows a wide range of signals to be switched while reducing or eliminating the negative effects of intermodulation in the output signal.\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>In accordance with the present invention, a low distortion compensated field effect transistor switch is disclosed which provides significant advantages over conventional field effect transistor switches.\n",
      "<br/><br/>According to one aspect of the present invention, an electronic switch is disclosed that comprises a switch element and compensation circuitry.  The switch element is operable to pass a signal between signal terminals responsive to a voltage\n",
      "applied to its control terminal.  The compensation circuitry applies a bias voltage to the control terminal that tracks an average of a voltage at the signal terminals and is offset by a substantially constant voltage magnitude.  The bias voltage insures\n",
      "a substantially uniform resistance across the switch element as the signal varies.  In one implementation, the switch element is a field effect transistor.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Further, according to another aspect, compensation circuitry can be coupled to a backgate of the switch element.  In this case, the compensation circuitry can apply a bias voltage to the backgate that tracks an average of the voltage at the\n",
      "signal terminals and is offset by a substantially constant voltage magnitude.  The second bias voltage offsets the backgate to back bias the backgate to channel semiconductor junction.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A technical advantage of the present invention is the application of voltages to the gate and backgate of a switch element to make more uniform the resistance across the switch for changes in the input signal.  The applied voltages can thereby\n",
      "reduce intermodulation distortion in the output signal of the switch.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another technical advantage of the present invention is the ability to decrease the size and increase the integration of a field effect transistor switch while also reducing intermodulation.  The switch provides more uniformity in switch\n",
      "resistance which reduces intermodulation within the device.  Reduction of the total transistor area by elimination of the low carrier mobility P-channel device reduces switch parasitic capacitance.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Other technical advantages of the present invention should be apparent from the drawings, specification and claims. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n",

      "<br/><br/>FIG. 10 is a diagram of typical switch voltages and on-resistance of the circuit of FIG. 9. <br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram of one embodiment of a self-balancing bridge measurement circuit.  As shown, this circuit includes a field effect transistor (FET) 12 having its gate connected to the output of an operational amplifier 14.  The power\n",
      "supplies of operational amplifier 14 are connected to a positive power supply (V.sub.CC) and ground potential in the (V.sub.EE).  The backgate of field effect transistor 12 is also connected to ground potential (V.sub.EE).  A signal source 16 provides a\n",
      "signal to the circuit through a first resistor 18.  Additional resistors 18, including a load resistor, are connected as shown.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, the circuit of FIG. 1 implements a self-balancing bridge measurement circuit.  The operational amplifier 14 forces the ratio of resistor R9 to resistor R12 to be equal to the ratio of resistor R17 to the channel resistance of field\n",
      "effect transistor 12.  In the case of a uniformly doped channel in field effect transistor 12, linearly sweeping the input voltage from signal source 16 results in a gate voltage that is a linear function of the input voltage.  It should be noted that\n",
      "non-uniform doping in the channel of transistor 12 would require some non-linear shaping of the gate voltage to maintain a substantially consistent channel resistance.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 2 is a diagram of a typical response of the circuit of FIG. 1.  As shown, FIG. 2 plots the voltage at the gate of field effect transistor 12,\n",
      "<br/><br/> the voltage at the source and the channel resistance.  From FIG. 2, it can be seen that the channel resistance remains substantially constant over the range of input voltages from signal source 16.  Further, it has been shown that changing the\n",
      "load resistance, and hence the drain current, for various field effect transistors 12 yields consistent results with that shown in FIG. 2.  These results generally follow the equation:\n",
      "<br/><br/>In this equation, K is a small positive or negative number with a magnitude generally less than 0.3, and V(offset) is the channel to gate voltage required to attain a specific on-resistance.  The circuit of FIG. 1 and results of FIG. 2 validate\n",
      "that a bias circuit can compensate the switch for reasonable values of input voltage and load resistance to generate a relatively flat resistance response across ranges of input voltages.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 3 is a block diagram of one embodiment of a compensated field effect transistor switch.  As shown in FIG. 3, the circuit comprises a switch element 20 which can be a field effect transistor device as discussed above.  Switch element 20\n",
      "receives a control (gate) signal from wave form shaping and time delay compensation circuitry 22.  Switch element 20 also receives a signal from in/out terminal 24 and connects/disconnects that signal to out/in terminal 26.  As shown, difference/sum\n",
      "amplifier circuitry 28 is coupled to receive the input and output signals of switch element 20.  In the case of a field effect transistor as switch element 20, this means that circuitry 28 is coupled to the drain and source of the field effect\n",
      "transistor.  Circuitry 28 is coupled to and provides an amplified difference/sum signal to circuitry 22.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, circuitry 28 and circuitry 22 of FIG. 3 operate to actively compensate the gate voltage of switch element 20 to insure consistent channel resistance for switch element 20 over reasonable values of input signals and load resistance. \n",
      "Although not shown, circuitry can also be used to compensate the backgate of switch element 20.  The compensation can apply a bias voltage that tracks an average of a voltage at the signal terminals and is offset by a substantially constant voltage\n",
      "magnitude.  In one embodiment, the substantially constant voltage magnitude is the voltage difference between the signal terminals.  Further, the difference voltage can be summed with the average voltage for additional compensation for some\n",
      "non-symmetrical parasitics and non-uniform channel doping profiles.  The bias voltage for the backgate (not shown) also can apply a voltage that tracks the average of the voltage at the signal terminals and is offset by a substantially constant voltage\n",
      "magnitude.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 4 is a circuit diagram of one embodiment of an implementation of the circuit of FIG. 3.  As shown, the circuit of FIG. 4 has a switch element 30 which is a MOSFET having its backgate connected to the most negative potential in the circuit\n",
      "(V.sub.EE).  A signal source 32 provides a signal to the source of transistor 30, and the drain of transistor 30 is connected to node 34.  Averaging circuitry 36 is coupled to receive both the input signal and output signal of transistor 30 provides an\n",
      "output signal to offset and sum circuitry 38.  Offset and sum circuitry 38 also receives an output signal from difference circuitry 40 which receives the input and output signals of transistor 30.  In operation, the circuit of FIG. 4 implements a field\n",
      "effect transistor switch in which the compensation of the gate voltage of transistor 30 insures substantially uniform channel resistance response across a range of input signals from signal source 32.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 5 is a diagram of a typical response of the circuit of FIG. 4.  As shown, FIG. 5 plots the voltage of the gate of transistor 30, the source of transistor 30 and the resistance across the channel of transistor 30.  As can be seen, due to the\n",
      "compensation of the gate voltage, the slope of the resistance is relatively small (i.e., the resistance is substantially uniform).  Further, this slope can be adjusted by changing the value of resistor R23 of FIG. 4.  Further, the value of the resistance\n",
      "at zero volts input signal can be adjusted with the offset voltage.  It should be noted that, in the diagram of FIG. 5, the plot excursion at zero volts is an artifact of the mathematical analysis.  The passage through zero volts in a physical circuit is\n",
      "actually quite smooth.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 6 is a generalized discrete monolithically integratable implementation of the circuit of FIG. 4.  As shown, a transistor device 50 has its source coupled to a voltage signal source 52 and its drain coupled to a node 54.  The gate of\n",
      "transistor 50 is connected to circuitry for compensating the gate voltage based upon the input and output voltage signals.  As shown, the circuitry includes a pair of current sources 56.  Further, this circuitry includes resistors 58, bipolar transistors\n",
      "60, and transistors 62 connected together as shown.  The compensation circuitry formed by these elements operates to compensate the gate voltage of transistor 50 to produce a more uniform channel resistance response across a range of input signals from\n",
      "voltage source 52.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 7 is a circuit diagram of one embodiment of a bi-directional compensated switch device using the circuit of FIG. 6.  As can be seen, the circuit of FIG. 7 duplicates some of the portions of the circuit of FIG. 6 to allow bi-directional\n",
      "compensated operation and to improve symmetry of signals passing either way through the circuit.  Otherwise, the circuit of FIG. 7 includes the same elements as that of FIG. 6 and operates in the same manner.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 8 is a diagram of the typical on-resistance of the circuit of FIG. 7.  As shown, the total on-resistance for the switch element of the circuit is plotted as well as the on-resistance of each transistor 50.  The slopes of the individual\n",
      "transistors 50 are adjusted by varying the size of the differential long-tailed pair current mirror amplifiers feeding the gates of transistors 50.  As can be seen, the circuit produces a substantially constant on-resistance for the parallel transistors\n",
      "50.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 9 is a circuit diagram of another embodiment of a field effect transistor switch with backgate linearity compensation.  As shown, FIG. 9 has an input signal source 70 and an output 72 coupled to the source and drain of a transistor 74. \n",
      "Transistor 74 has a gate and a backgate both of which are biased by compensation circuitry.  The compensation circuitry includes control circuitry 76 and biasing circuitry 78.  These circuits are formed by various bipolar transistors, resistors and field\n",
      "effect transistors, as shown.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In the circuit of FIG. 9, the resistor R9 sets the current through transistor Q14 and n-channel MOSFET MN6.  The current through Q14 is then mirrored through Q13 and Q12, allowing the voltage at the collector of Q12 to be set by a low impedance\n",
      "driving source.  Correspondingly, current through MN6 is mirrored in MN5 allowing the voltage on the drain of MN5 to be set by a low impedance driving source.  MN4 mirrors the current through MN6 which in turn supplies collector current to Q6 that is\n",
      "mirrored in Q7/Q8.  The Q8 collector voltage is set by a lower impedance driving source.  MN3 mirrors the current through MN6 and supplies collector current to Q5 that is mirrored through Q3/Q4.  The collector of Q3 then supplies current to the bases of\n",
      "the long-tailed transistor pair Q1/Q2.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, the circuit provides a low resistance signal path through the source/drain channel of transistor 74.  In the circuit of FIG. 9, the resistance of the signal path remains substantially constant over the required range of input\n",
      "voltage signals to produce low distortion in the output signal.  (Further, it should be noted that, although MOSFETs are shown, the same techniques can actually be used with compensating JFETs and can afford more advantages, such as increased input\n",
      "voltage range, when so used.)\n",
      "<br/><br/>For an \"on\" state of the signal switching device MN10, transistors MN7, MN8, MN9 and MN13 are biased \"on\".  This means that their source/drain resistance is very low with respect to the current they are required to pass.  Hence, there is an\n",
      "insignificant voltage drop across the device.  Also in this state, transistors MN11, MN12 are biased \"off\".  This means that a voltage at their source or drain is not affected by a voltage at their drain or source.  (Of course, the circuit could be\n",
      "operated in opposite states with these devices in the \"off\" rather than \"on\" or \"on\" rather than \"off\" states.) With the circuit in this \"on\" state, in the biasing circuitry 78, the input signal is applied to the base of Q1 and the output signal is\n",
      "applied to the base of Q2.  Then, the voltage at the junction of R1 and R2 is the average of the input and output voltage signals.  The collector currents of Q1 and Q2 are proportional to the differences of the input and output voltage signals.  The\n",
      "average voltage is applied to the base of emitter follower transistor Q10, supplying the average voltage with a base emitter voltage offset at the emitter.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To compensate for higher order non-linearities, the slope of the control voltages can be modified by adding or subtracting a voltage proportional to the difference of the input and output voltages.  This is accomplished, for example, by mirroring\n",
      "the collector current of Q2 through MN2 and into MN1.  These devices provide a current mirror amplifier as the current gain can be changed by controlling the ratio of the size of MN2 to MN1 and by changing the resistance of R5.  The current from MN1 is\n",
      "subtracted from current source Q8.  The change in current through resistor R5 caused by the change in the collector current of Q2 causes a voltage change that appears in the gate driving voltage of MN10.  The circuit can be placed in the collector of Q1,\n",
      "Q2, or both, as required.  Complete vertical mirroring of this circuit and the parallel connection of the two results in further alternatives in reducing distortion.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Transistor Q9, together with resistors R4 and R6, create a VBE multiplier circuit and produces a substantially constant voltage between the emitter and collector of Q9.  As the impedance presented by the collector at Q8 is very high (it is a\n",
      "current source), the voltage at the collector of Q9 is the offset average voltage from the differential pair Q1/Q2 that is further offset towards the positive supply rail by the VBE multiplier voltage.  This voltage is applied to the base of transistor\n",
      "74.  In the circuit of FIG. 8, Q11, R7 and R8 form another VBE multiplier that offsets the same offset average voltage towards the negative supply rail.  The voltage out of this VBE multiplier (the drain voltage of MN5) is applied to the back gate of\n",
      "transistor 74.  \"Off\" operations of the circuit can be obtained by reversing the \"on\" control transistors to \"off\" and the \"off\" transistors to \"on.\" This couples the gate and back gate of transistor 74 to the most negative voltage V.sub.EE in the\n",
      "circuit which causes the channel resistance to greatly increase.  In operation, device MN14 and R11 form a voltage inverter that supplies the requisite control voltages to the various control switching FETs.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 10 is a diagram of typical switch voltages and on-resistance of the circuit of FIG. 9.  As shown, the values of various voltages within FIG. 9 are plotted as a function of a swept input voltage signal.  The value of the resistance of the\n",
      "switching device is shown in the lower graph.  One uniqueness of the FET switch circuit of FIG. 9 is due to the application of voltages to the gate and backgate that track the average of the switch input and output voltages but are offset by constant\n",
      "voltage magnitudes.  The gate is offset to decrease the FET channel resistance.  The backgate is offset in the direction required to back bias the backgate/channel semiconductor junction.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, the application of the tracking voltage to the gate is a primary contributor to switch distortion reduction.  The backgate bias is a secondary contributor.  As should be understood, the compensation methods can be used together or\n",
      "separately.  Additionally, a voltage proportional to the difference of the input and output voltages can be added to or subtracted from the gate and back gate voltages to compensate for unequal source and drain contact resistances in the switching\n",
      "transistor and for various channel doping profiles.  This biasing can be used with the above compensation or separately.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As disclosed, the control gate can generally be made to follow the input signal This works fine for small amounts of current through the field effect transistor switch.  However, increased current results in a voltage drop between drain and\n",
      "source.  It has been found that, if the device if symmetrical, applying the average of the input and output voltages offset by some value to turn the device \"on\" results in improved linearity.  Further, if the backgate voltage is offset (the substrate in\n",
      "a discrete FET) to a voltage below the average of the output and input voltage, the higher order effects of the back gate on the characteristic curve of the FET is minimized to a large extent.\n",
      "<br/><br/>If the device is non-symmetrical (primarily, drain contact resistance does not equal source contact resistance), or there is a channel doping profile that results in a non-square law FET response, the non-linearity can be largely compensated by\n",
      "adding or subtracting (depending upon the cause of the non-linearity) a small amount of the difference between the input and output signals.  This changes the slope of the gate voltage with respect to the applied voltage.  Complete symmetry of the\n",
      "topology of the switch (as required to obtain electrical symmetry--indifference to which direction the signal is traveling) can require two pass elements to be placed in parallel and two compensation circuits to be used.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Although the present invention has been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended\n",

      "<br/><br/>The present invention relates in general to the field of digital subscriber line (xDSL) network filters and, more particularly, to a wall mount filter for a digital subscriber line (xDSL) network and methods of installation and manufacture.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) was originally designed for carrying analog voice communication signals.  However, users are increasingly using the PSTN to transmit digital data.  A typical PSTN network includes numerous central\n",
      "offices.  Communication between the central offices can be accomplished through high speed switched digital links.  Local loops couple the central offices to the customer premises.  The local loops can be analog networks of twisted pair copper wiring. \n",
      "These analog local loops are often referred to as the Plain Old Telephone System (POTS).  A \"customer premises network\", \"premises network\", or \"premises wiring\" typically connects electronic devices within the customer premises to the local loop.  For\n",
      "example, a typical premises network can comprise twisted pair wiring coupled to RJ-11 phone jacks.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The central office typically includes, among other elements, a bandpass filter that can limit the bandwidth of the local loop to approximately 3.3 kHz (between 300 Hz and 3.4 kHz).  This is done so that numerous voice-grade local loop lines can\n",
      "be digitized and multiplexed together for transmission between central offices over the switched digital links.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Current computing environments necessitate the need for digital transmission of data.  Several services such as leased or switched lines enable such data traffic, but can be prohibitively expensive.  Similarly, replacing the telephone\n",
      "infrastructure with a medium that is more conducive to digital traffic can also be prohibitively expensive.  Therefore, users desire to use POTS lines to transmit digital data.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Conventional modem technology is one such method of transmitting digital data over POTS lines.  This technology attempts to transmit high speed data over POTS lines within the limits of the allocated voice bandwidth, or below 3.4 kHz.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Digital Subscriber Line (xDSL) technology, on the other hand, can apportion the transmission of data over POTS lines into a voice channel and a digital channel.  The voice channel can include signals below 4 kHz while the digital channel can\n",
      "include signals above 4 kHz.  As such, xDSL can provide a method to increase the bandwidth of the existing telephone network infrastructure.  Furthermore, xDSL technology can allow conventional electronic devices that use the voice channel, and xDSL\n",
      "devices such as transceivers, to couple to the same POTS network.  Furthermore, the conventional devices and the xDSL devices can communicate simultaneously over the same wiring, using the respective channels.  To accomplish this task, splitters or\n",
      "filters can be used to separate the two channels.  Typically, a splitter or filter is placed both at the central office and the customer premises of an xDSL network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>One conventional filter architecture used at the customer premises end of an xDSL network is a distributed filter.  With a distributed filter architecture, a low pass filter is coupled between the premises network and each electronic device that\n",
      "uses signals in the voice channel.  For example, each telephone, facsimile machine, and other conventional telephony device would be coupled first to a low pass filter which would then be coupled to the telephone network of the customer premises (e.g.,\n",
      "via a standard telephone line).  Each low pass filter allows signals in the voice channel to travel to and from the conventional devices, while filtering out traffic and noise that can be caused by devices using the digital channel.  In this scheme,\n",
      "devices using the digital channel, such as xDSL transceivers, can connect directly into the premises network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Conventional distributed filter systems typically couple a box containing a low pass filter between a wall mount outlet and each conventional electronic device.  However, such conventional systems can be disadvantageous because they involve an\n",
      "additional piece of electronic equipment.  Such equipment can be positioned in the open, and can be interfered with, for example, by passing foot traffic.  Such conventional systems can also require additional monitoring to ensure that the low pass\n",
      "filter box does not become uncoupled from the wall mount outlet.\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>In accordance with the present invention, a wall mount filter for a digital subscriber line network and methods of installation and manufacture are disclosed that provide significant advantages over prior developed filter systems.\n",
      "<br/><br/>According to one aspect of the present invention, the wall mount filter includes a wall mount plate having a front surface and a back surface.  A connection port is coupled to the front surface of the wall mount plate.  The connection port is\n",
      "operable to electrically couple to an electronic device.  The filter also includes a low pass filter circuit coupled to the back surface of the wall mount plate.  The low pass filter circuit is in electrical connection with the connection port and is\n",
      "operable to be electrically coupled to a premises network.  The wall mount plate is operable to couple to a wall mount outlet with the front surface outward and the low pass filter circuit contained inside the wall mount outlet.\n",
      "<br/><br/>It is a technical advantage of the present invention that the wall mount filter allows voice and digital traffic in an xDSL network to travel on the same premises network without the need for an additional device coupled between a wall mount\n",
      "outlet and a conventional electronic device.\n",
      "<br/><br/>It is a further technical advantage of the present invention that the risk of a conventional electronic device being uncoupled from the premises network is reduced.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Other technical advantages should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the specification, claims and drawings. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n",
      "<br/><br/>A more complete understanding of the present invention and advantages thereof may be acquired by referring to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numbers indicate like features,\n",
      "and wherein:\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 1 is a block diagram of one embodiment of a conventional ADSL installation with a centralized POTS splitter;\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 2 is a block diagram of one embodiment of an ADSL installation with a distributed POTS filter using one embodiment of a wall mount filter according to the present invention;\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIGS. 3A, 3B, and 3C are front, side, and back views of one embodiment of a wall mount filter according to the present invention; and\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIGS. 4A and 4B are circuit diagrams of different embodiments of a low pass filter circuit of a wall mount filter according to the present invention. <br/><br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 1 is a block diagram of one embodiment of a conventional ADSL installation with a centralized POTS splitter.  Although this discussion is with respect to Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) technology, it should be understood that the\n",
      "present invention can be used with other current or future Digital Subscriber Line (collectively xDSL) technologies.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In the embodiment of FIG. 1, a central office 10 is coupled to a customer premises 20 through the Plain Old Telephone System (\"POTS\") telephone network 16.  Central office 10 comprises a POTS splitter 12 coupled to POTS network 16.  POTS splitter\n",
      "12 can split the signal on POTS network 16 into ADSL traffic 13 and regular telephone service traffic 14.  For example, regular telephone service traffic 14 could comprise signals below 4 kHz, while ADSL traffic 13 could comprise signals above 4 kHz.\n",
      "<br/><br/>At customer premises 20, POTS network 16 is coupled to premises network 18.  POTS splitter 22 can separate signals on premises network 18 into regular telephone service traffic 27 and ADSL traffic 29.  ADSL modem 24 can communicate using ADSL\n",
      "traffic 29 and can be coupled, for example, to personal computer 26.  Electronic devices such as phone 28 and fax 30 can communicate using regular telephone service traffic 27 from POTS splitter 22.  POTS splitter 12 and POTS splitter 22 can be, for\n",
      "example, passive filters.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, the ADSL protocol separates the available bandwidth on POTS network 16 into a voice band, below 4 kHz, and a digital band, between 4 kHz and 2 MHz.  With such an installation, a normal telephone conversation can be held while\n",
      "simultaneously transmitting or receiving digital data over the same telephone line.  Referring to FIG. 1, a user can use phone 28 to carry on a conversation while simultaneously using personal computer 26 and ADSL modem 24 to communicate with other\n",
      "devices, for example, over the Internet.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 2 is a block diagram of one embodiment of an ADSL installation with a distributed POTS filter using one embodiment of a wall mount filter according to the present invention.  As shown, central office 10 can comprise a POTS splitter 12 which\n",
      "separates traffic on POTS network 16 into regular telephone service traffic 14 and ADSL traffic 13.  Central office 10 is coupled to premises network 18 of customer premises 20 through POTS network 16.  However, unlike the installation of FIG. 1, in FIG.\n",
      "2, a distributed filter mechanism is employed.  This mechanism involves wall mount filters 40 which are coupled between regular equipment, such as phone 28 and fax 30, and premises network 18.  In this scheme, ADSL modem 24 does not require a filter and\n",
      "can couple directly to premises network 18 and personal computer 26.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, wall mount filters 40 of FIG. 2 can perform an analogous function as POTS splitter 22 of FIG. 1.  In particular, wall mount filters 40 can split regular telephone service traffic 27 from ADSL traffic 29.  In FIG. 2, wall mount\n",
      "filter 40 can accomplish the split by filtering out ADSL traffic 29 from premises network 18.  For example, wall mount filters 40 can each include a low pass filter circuit that filters out signals over 4 kHz.  In such a manner, wall mount filters 40 can\n",
      "maintain backward compatibility between ADSL network and POTS.  Further, such an installation can avoid disruption of service due to faults in ADSL equipment, such as ADSL modem 24.  Wall mount filters 40 can additionally prevent the impedance of phone\n",
      "28 and fax 30 from harming the ADSL transceiver on ADSL modem 24.  Furthermore, wall mount filters 40 can prevent noise created by ADSL traffic 29 from interfering with the operation of phone 28 and fax 30.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIGS. 3A, 3B, and 3C are front, side, and back views of one embodiment of a wall mount filter according to the present invention.  As shown in FIG. 3A, the wall mount filter, indicated generally at 40, includes a wall mount plate 42.  A\n",
      "connection port 44 is coupled to a front surface of wall mount plate 42.  In the embodiment of FIG. 3A, connection port 44 is a female RJ-11 telephone jack.  Screws 48 can couple wall mount filter 40 to a wall mount outlet.  A wall mount outlet is a\n",
      "fixture at customer premises 18 at which a connection to premises network 18 is made available.  Wall mount plate 42 can have, for example, a side 52 with a dimension of approximately 4.72 inches and a side 56 of a dimension of approximately 2.98 inches. Such dimensions can enable wall mount filter 40 to be coupled to \"standard\" wall mount outlets that are the conventional place of connection to a premises network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 3B is a side view of wall mount filter 40 of FIG. 3A.  As mentioned, wall mount filter 40 includes a wall mount plate 42 and connection port 44.  Screws 48 operate to couple wall mount filter 40 to a wall mount outlet.  In the embodiment of\n",
      "FIG. 3B, wall mount plate 42 has a depth 64 with a dimension of approximately 0.35 inches.  Wall mount filter 40 further includes a low pass filter circuit 60 coupled to a back surface of wall mount plate 42.  Low pass filter circuit 60 is electrically\n",
      "coupled to connection port 40.  Low pass filter circuit 60 is also operable to electrically couple to premises network, such as standard phone wiring that can exist in conventional premises networks.  In the embodiment of FIG. 3B, low pass filter circuit\n",
      "60 extends approximately 0.615 inches from wall mount plate 42.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 3C is a rear view of wall mount filter 40 of FIGS. 3A and 3B.  As mentioned above, wall mount plate 42 has a back surface upon which low pass filter circuit 60 is coupled.  Low pass filter circuit 60 is sized to fit inside and be contained\n",
      "within a wall mount outlet.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, wall mount filter 40 of FIGS. 3A-3C can be coupled to a wall mount outlet with low pass filter circuit 60 connected to the premises network.  Once installed, low pass filter circuit 60 can fit inside the wall mount outlet and thus\n",
      "is not seen by a user.  Connection port 44 then faces outward towards the user for receiving connections from electronic devices.  Regular phone equipment, such as a phone or facsimile machine, can be connected, for example using an RJ-11 connection, to\n",
      "connection port 44.  The dimensions of sides 52, 56 and depth 64 of wall mount plate 42 can be configured such that wall mount filter 40 can be installed without modification to an existing wall mount outlet.  After installation, low pass filter 60 is\n",
      "electrically coupled between connection port 44 and premises network.  Low pass filter circuit 60 can operate to prevent a device coupled to port 44 from interfering with or being interfered with by ADSL traffic on the premises network.  In such a\n",

      "<br/><br/>This invention relates in general to data communication, and more particularly to a communication server apparatus using frequency multiplexing and method.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>A communication server provides access to communication facilities.  For example, a communication server having a bank of modems may provide subscriber access to the modems for data communication.  A communication server may be associated with\n",
      "its own dedicated communication network, or with an existing communication network, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN).\n",
      "<br/><br/>As communication networks provide greater connectivity and access to information, there is an increasing demand for data communication at higher rates.  One solution to provide increased data rates replaces existing twisted pair wiring with high\n",
      "bandwidth media, such as coaxial cables or fiber optic links.  Other solutions adopt improved communication techniques using the existing hardware infrastructure.  For example, digital subscriber line (XDSL) technology provides higher bandwidth data\n",
      "service over existing twisted pair wiring.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To deliver data service to the subscriber, a communication server may provide a dedicated or permanent connection to its communication facilities.  For example, an existing communication server at a central office provides enough communication\n",
      "facilities to simultaneously service all PSTN subscribers.  However, all telephone subscribers may not desire data service.  Furthermore, the subscribers that desire data service may not simultaneously access the communication server.\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>In accordance with the present invention, the disadvantages and problems associated with communication servers have been substantially reduced or eliminated.  In particular, a communication server apparatus using frequency multiplexing and method\n",
      "are disclosed that provide data service to a number of subscribers using a reduced number of XDSL communication facilities.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a communication server includes a plurality of pairs of receiver/buffers and transmit/buffers coupled to associated twisted pair data lines.  The communication server also includes a\n",
      "plurality of pairs of frequency agile modulators and demodulators.  Each frequency agile modulator and demodulator pair is coupled to an associated receiver/buffer and transmit/buffer pair and is set to operate at a unique frequency.  The communication\n",
      "server further includes a plurality of pairs of demodulators and modulators.  Each demodulator and modulator pair has a designatable operation frequency.  A plurality of XDSL modems are each coupled to an associated demodulator and modulator pair.  A\n",
      "mixer is coupled to the pairs of frequency agile modulators and demodulators and coupled to the pairs of demodulators and modulators.  The mixer operates to combine signals from the frequency agile modulators and provide the combined signal to the\n",
      "demodulators.  The mixer further operates to combine signals from the modulators and provide the combined signal to the frequency agile demodulators.  The communication server includes a detector that operates to detect a need for data service on a\n",
      "selected twisted pair data line.  A controller is coupled to the detector and to the pairs of demodulators and modulators.  The controller operates to select one of the XDSL modems in response to detecting the need for data service.  The controller\n",
      "further operates to couple the selected twisted pair data line to the selected XDSL modem by designating the demodulator and modulator pair associated with the selected XDSL modem to operate at the unique frequency of the frequency agile modulator and\n",
      "demodulator associated with the selected twisted pair data line.\n",
      "<br/><br/>According to another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for coupling a selected subset of a plurality of twisted pair subscriber lines to a plurality of XDSL modems.  Each twisted pair subscriber line is split into a twisted\n",
      "pair data line and a twisted pair phone line.  For each twisted pair data line, signals received on the twisted pair data line are modulated at a unique frequency associated with the twisted pair data line.  The modulated received signals are mixed to\n",
      "produce a combined incoming signal.  For each XDSL modem, the combined incoming signal is demodulated at a designated frequency associated with the XDSL modem and outgoing signals are modulated at the designated frequency.  The modulated outgoing signals\n",
      "are mixed to produce a combined outgoing signal.  For each twisted pair data line, the combined outgoing signal is demodulated at the unique frequency associated with the twisted pair data line to recover signals for transmission on the twisted pair data\n",
      "line.  A need for data service is detected on a selected twisted pair data line, and one of the XDSL modems is selected in response to detecting the need for data service.  The selected XDSL modem is then coupled to the selected twisted pair data line by\n",
      "setting the designated frequency associated with the XDSL modem to the unique frequency associated with the selected twisted pair data line.\n",
      "<br/><br/>An important technical advantage of the present invention is that frequency multiplexing can be beneficial to a communication server located at a cable operator.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another important technical advantage of the present invention is the distribution of the switching function to allow scalability of the number of supported data lines and over-subscription of XDSL modems.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Important technical advantages of the present invention include a communication server that provides data service to a number of subscribers using a reduced number of XDSL communication facilities.  Over-subscription of data service is\n",
      "accomplished by selectively coupling a number of twisted pair data lines to a reduced number of XDSL modems.  A controller polls the data lines in succession to determine which subscribers of the communication system need data service.  Upon detecting a\n",
      "need for data service on a selected data line, the controller directs a switch to couple the selected data line to an available modem.  The communication server may then provide data service suitable for high bandwidth applications, such as\n",
      "video-on-demand, multimedia, or Internet access.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another important technical advantage of the present invention includes a communication server that provides over-subscribed XDSL data service using the existing infrastructure of the public switched telephone network (PSTN).  Asymmetric digital\n",
      "subscriber line (ADSL), symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL), high-speed digital subscriber line (HDSL), very high-speed digital subscriber line (VDSL), or other suitable XDSL technology can provide higher bandwidth data service over existing twisted\n",
      "pair wiring.  These technologies may support data service simultaneously with traditional telephone service using a separation technique, such as frequency division multiplexing.  In one embodiment, a splitter divides each incoming twisted pair\n",
      "subscriber line into a twisted pair phone line and a twisted pair data line.  The phone line is coupled to a telephone switch to provide telephone service and the data line is coupled to the communication server to provide over-subscribed XDSL data\n",
      "service.  The communication server and splitter may be located at a central office of the PSTN.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another important technical advantage of the present invention includes the management and monitoring of XDSL data service provided to subscribers.  To accomplish this, the communication server maintains an activity table to determine status\n",
      "information on twisted pair data lines and XDSL modems.  In addition, the communication server can track subscriber usage, monitor subscriber information and generate billing and demographic information.  In a particular embodiment, an activity detector\n",
      "disconnects a subscriber after a predetermined period of inactivity to release a modem for use by another subscriber.\n",
      "<br/><br/>An additional important technical advantage of the present invention includes switching the connections between data lines and the XDSL.sup.5 modems using frequency modulation and mixing.  Other important technical advantages are readily apparent\n",
      "to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n",

      "<br/><br/>Subscriber 12 includes a telephone 20 and a computer 22, both coupled to an interface 24.  A splitter 25 is coupled to subscriber line 16 and operates to split subscriber line 16 into a twisted pair phone line 26 and a twisted pair data line 28. \n",
      "Phone line 26 is coupled to telephone 20 using interface 24.  Similarly, data line 28 is coupled to computer 22 using interface 24.  Subscriber 12 refers to one or more components at the subscriber premises shown in FIG. 1, as well as the user of these\n",
      "components.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Telephone 20 is a traditional telephone transceiver, a cordless telephone transceiver, or any other device suitable for allowing communication over telephone line 26.  Computer 22 comprises a mainframe device, mini-frame device, server, desktop\n",

      "<br/><br/>FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>The present invention generally relates to management of computer networks, and relates more specifically to network access control mechanisms that authenticate and authorize users of passwords generated by the Fortezza cryptographic protocol.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>By remote network access, individuals or large groups may work with computers and networks from any location and at any time.  Remote access is the ability to connect to, or \"log-on\" to a computer network from a distant location.  Using remote\n",
      "access, mobile computer users, or computer users at remote sites, may access a network by dialing in to a network access server (\"NAS\") using a computer, modem and remote access software.  The NAS selectively permits or denies network traffic and thereby\n",
      "controls remote access to an Internet Service Provider, private corporate network or virtual private network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>However, the convenience of remote access comes at the expense of security.  A malicious user can use remote access to penetrate and attack a network.  For example, an unauthorized user can gain remote access to a machine with the intention of\n",
      "destroying, compromising, or stealing resources or information.  Thus, one important security issue for remote access is user identification and authentication, which is verifying that the person who dials in is authorized to access the network and is\n",
      "who he says he is.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another important security issue is user authorization.  Generally, after authentication of a user, an authorization phase begins.  Authorization is the process of defining what an authenticated user can do when the user accesses the network. \n",
      "For example, a network administrator may restrict remote users to specific servers and services, rather than letting them access any part of the network.  In general, the more authorization a user receives, the more stringent the authorization procedure\n",
      "would be.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Remote access security systems vary in complexity depending on the level of security needed.  Some networks rely on simple user identifier (\"ID\") and password systems.  In such a system, the NAS maintains user IDs and encrypted passwords as part\n",
      "of a system configuration file.  However, there are at least two major drawbacks to this approach.  The first drawback is that remote users need the flexibility of dialing in to the NAS that is closest to their location, while still being able to use the\n",
      "same user ID and password.  The second drawback of the user ID and password system is that its security derives only from controlled knowledge of the password.  Any Identification and Authentication (I&amp;A) mechanism based solely on \"something you know\" is\n",
      "considered weak authentication.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Strong authentication, on the other hand, is achieved through an I&amp;A mechanism based on \"something you know\" as well as \"something you have.\" An example of \"something you have\" that may be used to improve authentication is ownership of a Smart\n",
      "card, Token card or Crypto card.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A Fortezza security system is an example of strong authentication.  Fortezza security systems require each authorized user to possess an electronic card that can generate or is encoded with a password generated using the Fortezza cryptographic\n",
      "algorithm (a \"Fortezza Crypto card\").  The United States National Security Agency developed the Fortezza security system for the United States Department of Defense, to provide originator authentication as well as data integrity and data privacy.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Generally, a Fortezza security system includes a Fortezza Crypto card that stores unique encrypted information, and which executes encryption algorithms to produce a scrambled one-time password (\"OTP\").  The card is a self-contained hardware\n",
      "system, having its own CPU and memory, and which stores and authenticates Fortezza OTPs.  Each OTP is unique and is valid only for a particular interval of time.  Because each password created by this process is different every time, users cannot share\n",
      "their passwords, and intruders cannot reuse a stolen password.  Further information about Fortezza security systems is disclosed in Fortezza Application Developer's Guide, available on the Internet at: http://armadillo.huntsville.al.us/FADG/welcome.htm\n",
      "<br/><br/>While the Fortezza security system provides a high level of security, in the past it has been difficult to deploy.  Deployment of Fortezza depends on setting up a sophisticated infrastructure to support Fortezza's specialized hardware and\n",
      "interface specifications.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In one approach, users access a network by dialing in to special NASs that are dedicated to support Fortezza technology exclusively.  These special NASs are not configured to support any other authentication and authorization mechanism other than\n",
      "Fortezza.  A different set of NASs are maintained to support the other authentication and authorization mechanisms that are not only less specialized than Fortezza but typically involve lower user access privileges corresponding to weaker authentication\n",
      "and authorization.  Thus, an Internet Service Provider, corporate network, or virtual private network would need to maintain several security systems in order to support users with different password types.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system 100 in which the Fortezza security system can be used.  Generally, system 100 includes a client 102, a user 106 associated with client 102, a network access server 104, and a network 108.  Client 102 is used\n",
      "by and associated with a user 106.  Client 102 and network access server 104 are respectively located in logically distinct regions 101, 103, which may be geographically separate.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Client 102 is a device, such as a workstation or personal computer, that is capable of dialing in to the network access server 104 to establish a connection 116.  Client 102 may be a Sun workstation running Solaris.  A card reader 107b is coupled\n",
      "to client 102 to communicate data and commands between the client and a Fortezza card 107a.  In an embodiment, card reader 107b is a PCMCIA card reader such as Litronic ARGUS/2100, and Fortezza card 107a is a compatible PCMCIA card.  Card reader 107b may\n",
      "communicate with client 102 over a SCSI port.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The network 108 is a network that includes any number of network devices 118, 120, 122 interconnected by one or more communication channels 109.  Ethernet, Token Ring, or other protocols can characterize the communication channels 109. \n",
      "Communication channels 109 may form part of a local area network or wide area network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The network access server 104 is a computer, or one or more hardware or software components or processes that cooperate or execute in one or more computer systems.  The network access server 104 is coupled to the network 108 and controls remote\n",
      "access to the network 108 and the network devices 118, 120, 122.  An example of a product that is suitable for use as network access server 104 is model AS5300, commercially available from Cisco Systems, Inc.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The network access server 104 may execute an application program 110 that is compiled and linked with a cryptologic library 112.  The application program 110 invokes the functions in the cryptologic library 112.  The cyptologic library\n",
      "communicates with a Fortezza security server 114.  Thus, cryptologic library 112 provides an interface that enables network access server 104 to communicate with Fortezza security server 114.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Fortezza security server 114 is a computer, or one or more hardware and software components or processes that cooperate or execute in one or more computer systems.  While Fortezza is a hardware-based authentication method, the electronic hardware\n",
      "that carries out Fortezza authentication may be controlled by software elements that command the hardware what to do, provide input data, and receive output data.  Fortezza products that are suitable for use as cryptologic library 112 and Fortezza\n",
      "security server 114 are commercially available from Secure Computing Inc., Litronic Inc., and Rainbow Technologies Inc.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The user 106 associated with client 102 causes the client to establish a connection 116.  For example, user 106 may enter user access information such as a valid username and password at a login window displayed by client 102, and by inserting a\n",
      "Fortezza Crypto card 107a into a Fortezza card reader 107b.  One or more application programs executed by Client 102 receive the user access information.  When inserted in the Fortezza card reader 107b, the Fortezza Crypto card 107a may perform a\n",
      "mathematical hash algorithm on the user access information, to produce a one-time password that is unique for every login.  The one-time password may be stored in the form of a hash value.  Client 102 sends the user access information and the hash value\n",
      "to network access server 104 over connection 116.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Upon receiving the hash value through connection 116, network access server 104 forwards the hash value to application program 110.  The application program 110 may invoke appropriate functions in the cryptologic library 112, which in turn\n",
      "communicates the hash value and user access information to Fortezza server 114.  Based on the hash value, the Fortezza server 114 determines if the user 106 is authorized to access the network 108 and what set of access privileges the user 106 is allowed\n",
      "to obtain.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The drawback is that the network access server 104 can only support Fortezza passwords.  Separate network access servers are maintained to support other types of passwords.  Thus, in a computer network that supports users of different password\n",
      "types, many different NASs need to be maintained to implement different security systems, thereby complicating the task of network administration.  When a user deploys a system secured by Fortezza, the user must also procure another product or system to\n",
      "carry out authorization of services.\n",
      "<br/><br/>This arrangement is also inconvenient because a particular user may have multiple passwords and may require multiple password technologies to access different resources of the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Further, currently available Fortezza systems do not enable an administrator to manage user name and password information in a database such as a relational database management system (RDBMS).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Based on the foregoing, there is a clear need for a mechanism allowing users of Fortezza passwords to use computer networks in conjunction with other authentication and authorization mechanisms, thereby facilitating ease of network\n",
      "administration.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In particular, there is a need for a mechanism that can receive and authenticate Fortezza passwords within a system that also receives and authenticates other types of passwords for users who do not use Fortezza passwords or crypto cards.\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>The foregoing needs, and other needs and objects that will become apparent for the following description, are achieved in the present invention, which comprises, in one aspect, a method of receiving and authenticating a Fortezza password within a\n",
      "computer system that also receives and authenticates passwords of other types and to thereby selectively permit a client associated with the Fortezza password to access a network that is protected by the computer system, comprising the steps of\n",

      "the access control server and logically interposed between the client and the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>According to still another feature, the step of determining the password type further involves the step of accessing a user profile that is stored in the database and that stores profile information of a plurality of users, in which the profile\n",

      "<br/><br/>A method and apparatus for allowing users of Fortezza passwords to use computer networks with other authentication and authorization mechanisms is described.  In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific\n",
      "details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention.  It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.  In other instances,\n",
      "well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.\n",
      "<br/><br/>OPERATIONAL CONTEXT\n",
      "<br/><br/>In one embodiment of the invention, a client sends a message containing user access information to a network access server (\"NAS\"), requesting that a connection be established.  Upon receiving the request, the network access server sends the user\n",
      "access information to a centralized server, such as an Access Control Server (\"ACS\").\n",
      "<br/><br/>The ACS provides a central point of control for the management of multiple security services, and network devices.  The ACS determines who may access the network, what services they are authorized to use, and to whom the services are to be\n",
      "charged and for how much.  Thus, the ACS provides Authorization, Authentication, and Accounting (\"AAA\") functions for a managed network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The ACS may be used simultaneously with dial-up NASs, routers and firewalls.  Each of the network devices can be configured to communicate with the ACS.  Thus, the ACS can be used as a central server to manage and control access to network\n",
      "devices.  For example, different groups of network managers having different authorization privileges with respect to the network devices, can simultaneously manage security services from multiple locations.  An example of an ACS is CiscoSecure.TM.  ACS\n",
      "2.2 for UNIX, commercially available from Cisco Systems, Inc.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The ACS integrates and supports various authentication and authorization technologies, including token cards, and Fortezza security systems.  The ACS may communicate with a relational database to simplify the storage of user and group profile\n",
      "information against which users are authenticated.  The user or group profile information may include authentication information to validate identity and authorization information to determine what parts of the internal network and services a user or\n",
      "group can access.  In addition, accounting information related to what the user has done or is doing can be stored in the relational database for billing and security auditing.  The ACS allows system administrators to use a variety of authentication\n",
      "mechanisms with varying degrees of authorization privileges.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In one embodiment, the system is integrated with a service provider that has multiple points of presence (\"POP\"), so that there is an ACS at each of the major POPs.  A NAS is able to authenticate and authorize users by communicating with the ACS\n",
      "that is logically or physically closest to the NAS.\n",
      "<br/><br/>USING FORTEZZA PASSWORDS IN A SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS OTHER AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS\n",
      "<br/><br/>1.  OVERVIEW OF ARCHITECTURE\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a system 200 in which the invention can be implemented.  System 200 may include a user 106, client 102, Fortezza card 107a, Fortezza card reader 107b, connection 116, and network access server 104 at regions 101, 103\n",
      "in a configuration similar to that of system 100 of FIG. 1.  Also like system 100 of FIG. 1, system 200 of FIG. 2 is configured to protect and allow selective access to network devices 118, 120, 122 of network 108.  In addition, system 200 may have an\n",

      "<br/><br/>As shown in FIG. 2, in the preferred embodiment, Access Control Server 202 is coupled logically between network access server 104 and network 108 to thereby selectively control communications between client 102 and the network.  Access Control\n",
      "Server 202 may execute an application program that provides user authentication functions to network access server 104 upon request.  An example of a commercial product suitable for use as Access Control Server 202 is CiscoSecure ACS version 2.2.2, from\n",
      "Cisco Systems, Inc.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Access Control Server 202 also has access control server library 205, which communicates with a cryptologic library 112.  The access control server library 205 is a collection of precompiled software modules.  For example, access control server\n",
      "library 205 may call functions of cryptologic library 112 to carry out functions relating to Fortezza passwords.  Fortezza server 114 is coupled logically to cryptologic library 112, which may call the Fortezza server to carry out functions relating to\n",
      "processing Fortezza passwords.  For example, access control server library 205 may call functions of cryptologic library 112, which in turn may send requests to or receive responses from Fortezza server 114 in order to carry out the functions that are\n",
      "called.  The functions may be called through an application programming interface (API).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Hardware elements of Fortezza security server 114 may reside in the same physical computer as access control server 202.  A computer that runs Sun's Solaris operating system is suitable to serve as access control server 202, but the Solaris\n",
      "platform is not required.  An example of a suitable computer configuration is: Sparc 20, 167 MHz, 256 MB RAM, running Solaris version 2.5.1 or 2.6.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A database 204 and a security server 203 are coupled to Access Control Server 202.  The database may store user or group profile information as well as accounting information related to use of the computer network.  The security server 203 may\n",
      "authorize and authenticate non-Fortezza specific passwords.  Examples of commercial database systems that are suitable for use as database 204 include Oracle RDBMS version 7.3.2 or later, and Sybase RDBMS version 11.2 or later.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In an alternate embodiment, Access Control Server 202 may be coupled only to network access server 104, and network 108 may be coupled to the network access server so that the network access server is logically interposed between client 102 and\n",
      "the network.  In the alternate configuration, Access Control Server 202 may interact with the network access server to determine when the network access server may give client 102 access to network 108.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Database 204 stores a profile of each user who is authorized to use network 108 and who may be authenticated by access control server 202.  The profile is a set of values that collectively define the rights and privileges of the user.  Access\n",
      "control server 202 also provides a command line interface that is augmented to enable an administrator to specify that the type of password used by a particular user is Fortezza.  In the preferred embodiment, access control server 202 provides a command\n",
      "line interface that accepts an \"add user profile\" command having the syntax\n",
      "<br/><br/>where \"-pw\" is either a password type value, or a password type value combined with a password specification.  The \"-pw\" parameter defines which passwords to add to the user's profile.  Password types that require a password specification include\n",
      "\"clear\", \"ARAP\", \"PAP\", \"DES\", \"String\", and \"Outbound PAP.\" When the user is to use a password type that does not require a password specification, such as Fortezza, then only the type is entered, for example, -pw FORTEZZA\n",
      "<br/><br/>In response, the access control server 202 adds the user profile to database 204.  Alternatively, a user with a Fortezza password may be added database 204 using functions available in a graphical user interface provided by the access control\n",
      "server 202.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Advantageously, in this configuration, access control server 202 can authenticate Fortezza passwords as well as passwords of many other types, all in an integrated server.  A separate ACS dedicated to Fortezza is not required.  Accordingly, the\n",
      "system is simpler than past approaches, more easily maintained, and more versatile.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In addition, the Fortezza passwords are maintained in a database along with user profile information for users who are associated with passwords of many different types.  This advance enables a network administrator to manage Fortezza password\n",
      "users far more easily and efficiently than in the past.\n",
      "<br/><br/>2.  LOGICAL RELATIONSHIP OF FORTEZZA ELEMENTS\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating a logical relationship of elements of FIG. 2 that are involved in processing Fortezza passwords, according to an embodiment.  Part of FIG. 4 is what was referred to as the Fortezza server 114, shown in\n",
      "greater detail here.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Access control server library 205, executed by Access Control Server 202, may invoke functions of the cryptologic library 112, which is thus depicted in FIG. 4 as immediately logically below the access control server library.  The cryptologic\n",
      "library 112 provides the access control server library 205 with a software interface to the Fortezza Crypto card's functions while abstracting the specific data formats, protocols, and the Fortezza Crypto card interface requirements.\n",
      "<br/><br/>At the next lower logical layer is device driver 404.  The device driver 404 provides cryptographic library 112 with an interface to the lower logical layers.  The device driver 404 is operating system independent.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Logically below device driver 404 is card services 406, which allocates and controls operating system and hardware resources for the Fortezza Crypto card.  Card services 406 preferably is a software element that carries out functions that include\n",
      "directing power requirements, resetting the hardware device that connects to the Fortezza Crypto card, reading card configuration information, and performing reads and writes from and to the Fortezza Crypto card's memory.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Socket services layer 408 provides a software interface between the host computer, typically the same computer as the ACS, and the hardware used to manage the Fortezza Crypto card.  Socket services 408 is responsible for detecting interrupts from\n",
      "the Fortezza Crypto card, setting power levels, and mapping the Fortezza Crypto card memory to a specific area of memory available in the host.\n",
      "<br/><br/>At the lowest logical levels are the Fortezza card reader 409a and the Fortezza Crypto cards 409b, 409c, 409d.  Typically, Fortezza card reader 409a is configured to read any number of Fortezza Crypto cards, 409b, 409c, 409d.  Fortezza card\n",
      "reader 409a may also include an adaptor comprising hardware, such as an integrated circuit, that communicates with the Fortezza Crypto cards 409b, 409c, 409d.  Alternatively, the adaptor may reside within the host, for example, on its motherboard.  The\n",
      "Fortezza card reader 409a transmits data to and from the Fortezza Crypto cards 409b, 409c, 409d.  Fortezza Crypto cards 409b, 409c, 409d read data from the host, processes it, then, make the data available to the host.\n",
      "<br/><br/>3.  METHOD OF USE\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method for allowing users of Fortezza passwords to use computer networks supporting a variety of authentication and authorization technologies.  FIG. 3 will be explained with reference to the\n",
      "components in FIG. 2.  However, the method of FIG. 3 may be implemented with any other arrangement of hardware and software elements that may carry out the functions needed in the method of FIG. 3.  Thus, the method of FIG. 3 is not intended to be\n",
      "limited to the context of FIG. 2.\n",
      "<br/><br/>At block 300 of FIG. 3, client 102 establishes a connection 116 with the network access server 104.  For example, user 106 associated with client 102 causes the client 102 to dial in and send user access information to the network access server\n",
      "104.  The user access information typically contains a username and password.  The password can be a fixed password or an OTP type password obtained through the use of a Smart card or Token card, depending on the level of authentication.  The password\n",
      "type can also be a Fortezza password which is a unique hash value produced by a Fortezza Crypto card 107a and Fortezza card reader 107b.  The more authorization privileges a user receives, the stronger the authentication would be.\n",
      "<br/><br/>At block 302, the network access server 104 receives user access information from client 102.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In system 200, the communications function of accessing the network, and the structure that supports this function, are separated from the security functions and the structure that carries them out.  Hence, at block 304, the network access server\n",
      "104 passes the user access information to the Access Control Server 202.  The network access server 104 controls modems and ports that are used to connect to network 108, but does not examine the type of password contained in the user access information. It simply forwards the user access information to the Access Control Server 202 which is a point of centralized control of network access and the provision security services.\n",
      "<br/><br/>At block 306, the Access Control Server 202 determines the type of password that is contained in the user access information.  The database 204 stores user or group profiles containing authentication and authorization information for each user or\n",
      "group.  Based on the profile, and the user identifier that is contained in the user access information, the Access Control Server 202 finds a user profile in the database 204 that corresponds to the user.  The Access Control Server 202 then is able to\n",
      "determine the type of password the user access information contains.\n",
      "<br/><br/>At block 308, if it is determined that the password is a Fortezza password, then control passes to block 312.  Otherwise control passes to block 310.  At block 310, the Access Control Server 202 invokes the appropriate server when, for example, a\n",
      "token card authentication is required.  For example, at block 310, Access Control Server 202 may invoke security server 203 to authenticate a token card.\n",
      "<br/><br/>At block 312, the Access Control Server 202 invokes the access control server library that in turn invokes functions in the cryptologic library 112.  The cryptologic library 112 communicates with the Fortezza server 114 and acts as an\n",
      "intermediary between access control server 202 and Fortezza server 114.  An example of a suitable cryptologic library is LOCKOut Fortezza Unix Host version 1.2, available from Secure Computing, Inc.  In an embodiment, an AAA server portion of the access\n",
      "control server 202 communicates with LockOut Fortezza using an agreed-upon API.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Fortezza server 114 authenticates the password received from the user access information, and in block 316 sends a message indicating whether the password is valid or not.  In one embodiment, if the password is not valid, the Fortezza server\n",
      "may send a message, requesting user 106 to try again.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Thus, a system and method permit a user of a Fortezza password to gain access to a network through the same network access server and access control server that serve users who have other types of passwords.  For example, the system and method\n",
      "may be used in an environment in which passwords of users are authenticated using SafeWord AS, Security Dynamics' Ace one-time-password server, and other authentication mechanisms as well as Fortezza.\n",
      "<br/><br/>HARDWARE OVERVIEW\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 5 is a block diagram that illustrates a computer system 500 upon which an embodiment of the invention may be implemented.  Computer system 500 includes a bus 502 or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a processor\n",
      "504 coupled with bus 502 for processing information.  Computer system 500 also includes a main memory 506, such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to bus 502 for storing information and instructions to be executed by\n",
      "processor 504.  Main memory 506 also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor 504.  Computer system 500 further includes a read only memory (ROM) 508 or\n",
      "other static storage device coupled to bus 502 for storing static information and instructions for processor 504.  A storage device 510, such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus 502 for storing information and instructions.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Computer system 500 may be coupled via bus 502 to a display 512, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a computer user.  An input device 514, including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus 502 for communicating\n",
      "information and command selections to processor 504.  Another type of user input device is cursor control 516, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor 504 and for\n",
      "controlling cursor movement on display 512.  This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The invention is related to the use of computer system 500 for allowing users of Fortezza passwords to use computer networks with other authentication and authorization mechanisms.  According to one embodiment of the invention, the allowing users\n",
      "of Fortezza passwords to use computer networks with other authentication and authorization mechanisms is provided by computer system 500 in response to processor 504 executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory\n",
      "506.  Such instructions may be read into main memory 506 from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device 510.  Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory 506 causes processor 504 to perform the process steps\n",
      "described herein.  In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention.  Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of\n",
      "hardware circuitry and software.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The term \"computer-readable medium\" as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor 504 for execution.  Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile\n",
      "media, and transmission media.  Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device 510.  Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory 506.  Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire\n",
      "and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus 502.  Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red data communications.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punchcards, papertape, any other physical medium with\n",
      "patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor 504 for execution.  For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote\n",
      "computer.  The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem.  A modem local to computer system 500 can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red\n",
      "transmitter to convert the data to an infra-red signal.  An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus 502.  Bus 502 carries the data to main memory 506, from which\n",
      "processor 504 retrieves and executes the instructions.  The instructions received by main memory 506 may optionally be stored on storage device 510 either before or after execution by processor 504.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Computer system 500 also includes a communication interface 518 coupled to bus 502.  Communication interface 518 provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link 520 that is connected to a local network 522.  For example,\n",
      "communication interface 518 may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line.  As another example, communication interface 518 may be a local area\n",
      "network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN.  Wireless links may also be implemented.  In any such implementation, communication interface 518 sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that\n",
      "carry digital data streams representing various types of information.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Network link 520 typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices.  For example, network link 520 may provide a connection through local network 522 to a host computer 524 or to data equipment operated by\n",
      "an Internet Service Provider (ISP) 526.  ISP 526 in turn provides data communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \"Internet\" 528.  Local network 522 and Internet 528 both use\n",
      "electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams.  The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link 520 and through communication interface 518, which carry the digital data to and from computer\n",
      "system 500, are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Computer system 500 can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link 520 and communication interface 518.  In the Internet example, a server 530 might transmit a requested code for an application\n",
      "program through Internet 528, ISP 526, local network 522 and communication interface 518.  In accordance with the invention, one such downloaded application provides for allowing users of Fortezza passwords to use computer networks with other\n",
      "authentication and authorization mechanisms as described herein.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The received code may be executed by processor 504 as it is received, and/or stored in storage device 510, or other non-volatile storage for later execution.  In this manner, computer system 500 may obtain application code in the form of a\n",
      "carrier wave.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof.  It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit\n",
      "and scope of the invention.  The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.\n",

      "<br/><br/>The present invention pertains to the field of data transmission.  More particularly, this invention relates to an arrangement of minimizing signal reflection along a transmission line of a data transmission system without terminating the\n",
      "transmission line.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>A computer system or a data transmission system typically includes a number of devices or modules that communicate with each other using a bus.  The bus is essentially comprised of a transmission line or a number of transmission lines that may\n",
      "carry signals such as clock, control, data, and address signals among the devices.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The timing and distribution of signals along the bus is often of critical importance in the computer or data transmission system.  However, as with other types of transmission lines, signal reflection along a transmission line of the bus may\n",
      "frustrate signal timing and distribution.  Signal reflections are created when the bus interfaces with a component that has an impedance which differs from the characteristic impedance of the bus.  In other words, impedance discontinuities on the bus\n",
      "will generate reflections.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In particular, signal reflections can have a detrimental effect on the speed and operation of the system.  The devices communicating on the bus might have to wait until the reflections have subsided before accepting any signal from the bus as\n",
      "valid.  This waiting period tends to slow the system down.  Alternatively, if a sufficient waiting period has not elapsed, then signal reflections might be misinterpreted as valid signals resulting in unpredictable operation of the system.\n",
      "<br/><br/>One prior art method of decreasing the effect of signal reflections requires the use of terminators.  A terminator is a dissipative load, typically a resistor, located at the end of a transmission line.  The terminator is chosen to have an\n",
      "impedance that matches the characteristic impedance of the transmission line.  Prior art termination architectures includes series termination and parallel termination.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In series termination, the terminating resistor is placed in series with the device driving the transmission line.  In parallel termination, the device drives the transmission line directly and a terminator is placed at one or both ends of the\n",
      "transmission line.  A bus with a parallel termination at one end of the bus is referred to as a single parallel termination bus.  Alternatively such a bus may be called a singly terminated bus.  A bus with parallel terminations at both ends is referred\n",
      "to as a double parallel termination bus.  Alternatively such a bus may be called a doubly terminated bus.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 1 shows a prior art a data transmission system 10 with a doubly terminated bus 11.  As can be seen from FIG. 1, resistors 13a through 13n are termination resistors at one end of bus 11 and resistors 14a through 14n are termination resistors\n",
      "at the other end of bus 11 such that bus 11 is terminated at both ends of the transmission lines of bus 11.  Each of termination resistors 13a-13n and 14a-14n has an impedance which corresponds to the impedance of its corresponding transmission line of\n",
      "bus 11.  In this way, when a signal is carried along a transmission line of bus 11 to its termination resistor, the resistor absorbs the signal energy, thus eliminating signal reflections which may occur on the bus and cause erroneous signals.  FIG. 2\n",
      "shows the energy distribution of a typical data transmission along the transmission line of bus 11.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Disadvantages are, however, still associated with such prior art bus system.  One disadvantage associated is that the termination resistors typically consume energy of the signal.  This typically requires the device that sends the data signal to\n",
      "the transmission line to increase the power of the data signal so that the data signal can propagate through the transmission line.  This in turn causes the transmission system to dissipate more power to transmit the data signal.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another disadvantage associated with terminating the transmission line using termination resistors is that the termination resistors typically occupy some space on the printed circuit board on which the bus is configured.  This typically\n",
      "increases the size of the printed circuit board which in turn increases the size of the entire system.\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>One of the features of the present invention is to minimize signal reflection along a transmission line of a data transmission system without terminating the transmission line.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another feature of this present invention is to reduce power loss along a transmission line by eliminating the terminating resistors connected to the transmission line.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another feature of the present invention is to encode data to be transmitted along a transmission line to allow energy of the encoded data to be substantially concentrated around a predetermined frequency such that data transmission devices can\n",
      "be spaced apart along the transmission line at non-zero integer times of one half of a wavelength distance, wherein the wavelength is determined based on the predetermined frequency.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In a data transmission system having a first and a second data transmission device and a transmission line that is not terminated, a method of minimizing signal reflection along the transmission line is described that includes the step of\n",
      "connecting the first and second data transmission devices to the transmission line such that the distance between the first and second data transmission devices is substantially proportional to a wavelength of a predetermined frequency.  Data to be\n",

      "<br/><br/>FIG. 3 shows a data transmission system 30 that implements one embodiment of the present invention.  As can be seen from FIG. 3, data transmission system 30 includes a transmission line 31 that is connected to a pair of data transmission devices\n",
      "32 and 33 at points or nodes 34 and 35, respectively.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Data transmission system 30 can be a computer system, a data processing system, or a network communication system.  For one embodiment, system 30 is a computer system.  For another embodiment, data transmission system 30 is a network switching\n",
      "system.  Furthermore, data transmission system 30 can be other type of data processing system.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Transmission line 31 represents the bus of data transmission system 30.  FIG. 3 only shows one transmission line for the bus.  In practice, the bus includes many more lines, including transmission line 31.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Similarly, FIG. 3 only shows data transmission devices 32 and 33 within data transmission system 30.  In practice, data transmission system 30 may include many more data transmission devices.  Each of data transmission devices 32 and 33 can\n",
      "transmit and receive data from the other device via transmission line 31.  When one of devices 32 and 33 is transmitting data to the other device, the transmitting device is referred to as the bus master and the receiving device is referred to as the bus\n",
      "slave.  FIG. 3 only shows that device 32 functions as the bus master and device 33 functions as the bus slave.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Each of devices 32 and 33 is a semiconductor integrated circuit device or module.  Each of devices 32 and 33 performs a predetermined function.  For example, each of devices 32 and 33 can be a processor, a memory (e.g., DRAM, SRAM, or\n",
      "electrically erasable and programmable nonvolatile memory), a microcontroller, or an application specific integrated circuit (\"ASIC\").\n",
      "<br/><br/>As can be seen from FIG. 3, device 32 has an I/O pad 32a that is connected to point 34 of transmission line 31 and device 33 has an I/O pad 33a connected to point 35 of transmission line 31.  The distance of transmission line 31 between points 34\n",
      "and 35 is equal to n.cndot..lambda./2, wherein n is a non-zero integer and .lambda.  represents the wavelength of a periodic signal.  In addition, the tap distance for each of lines 38 and 39 is equal to n.cndot..lambda./4.  As can be seen from FIG. 3,\n",
      "line 38 is connected between node 34 and I/O pad 32a and line 39 is connected between node 35 and I/O pad 33a.  As is known, the tap distance is the line distance between node 34 to I/O pad 32a or between node 35 to I/O pad 33a.  The determination of the\n",
      "wavelength .lambda.  is conducted in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention which will be described in more detail below, in conjunction with FIGS. 4-8.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring again to FIG. 3, transmission line 31 is not terminated.  Alternatively, transmission line 31 can be singly terminated or doubly terminated.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Device 32 includes an encoding circuit 32b and device 33 includes a decoding circuit 33b, as can be seen from FIG. 3.  Encoding circuit 32b receives the data to be transmitted to device 33 via transmission line 31 from other circuits (not shown)\n",
      "within data transmission device 32.  Encoding circuit 32b receives the data at a predetermined data rate f.sub.D.  Encoding circuit 32b then encodes the data and transmits the encoded data to device 33 via transmission line 31 at the data rate f.sub.D. \n",
      "Encoding circuit 32b encodes the data using a memory encoding scheme in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.  The memory encoding scheme allow energy of the encoded data to be substantially concentrated at a frequency f.sub.0 that is\n",
      "approximately equal to 0.4 f.sub.D (see FIG. 8).  This in turn allows spectral energy control of the dispersion frequencies related to the data.  The memory encoding scheme will be described in more detail below, in conjunction with FIGS. 4-8.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring again to FIG. 3, device 33 receives the encoded data from transmission line 31.  Decoding circuit 33b of device 33 decodes the encoded data and then sends the decoded data to circuits (not shown) within device 33 where the decoded data\n",
      "are intended.  The decoding process of decoding circuit 33b is the reverse process of the encoding process of encoding circuit 32b and can be easily understood by any person skilled in the art after having learned the memory encoding scheme.  Hence,\n",
      "decoding circuit 33b and its function will not be described in more detail below.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As will be described in more detail below, because the data transmitted along transmission line 31 are encoded in accordance with the memory encoding scheme shown in FIGS. 5-6D of one embodiment of the present invention, the energy of the encoded\n",
      "data is concentrated at the frequency f.sub.0 (see FIG. 8).  This, therefore, allows devices 32 and 33 to be spaced apart along transmission line 31 at non-zero integer times (i.e., 1, 2, 3, .  . .) of one half wavelength of the frequency f.sub.0.  In\n",
      "addition, the tap distance of each of lines 38 and 39 is made to be non-zero integer times of one fourth wavelength of the frequency f.sub.0.  This effectively eliminates signal reflection along transmission line 31 without the need to terminate\n",
      "transmission line 31.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As can be seen from FIG. 2, an unencoded data stream with equal binary values (i.e., 50-50 chances of a logical one or zero) typically does not have its energy concentrated at any frequency.  This is due to the fact that a data stream typically\n",
      "has random appearance of the logical high value (i.e., logical one) and logical low value (i.e., logical zero).  However, when the data are encoded in accordance with the memory encoding scheme of the present invention, the signal energy is concentrated\n",
      "around the frequency f.sub.0, wherein f.sub.0 equals approximately 0.4 f.sub.D.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Because the signal energy of the encoded data along transmission line 31 is substantially concentrated around the frequency f.sub.0 (see FIG. 8), signal reflections are avoided along transmission line 31 when devices 32 and 33 are spaced apart\n",
      "along transmission line 31 at non-zero integer times (i.e., 1, 2, 3, .  . .) of one half of the wavelength .lambda.  of the f.sub.0 frequency and the tap distance for each of lines 38 and 39 is set at non-zero integer times of one fourth wavelength of\n",
      "the f.sub.0 frequency.  This effectively eliminates the signal reflections along transmission line 31 without requiring termination of transmission line 31.  In addition, this causes the impedance of each of devices 32 and 33 to match to the\n",
      "characteristic impedance of transmission line 31, thus making each of devices 32 and 33 transparent to the remainder of system 30.  The memory encoding scheme and the determination of the f.sub.0 frequency will be described in more detail below.\n",
      "<br/><br/>For one embodiment, the distance between points 34 and 35 equals one half of the wavelength .lambda.  of the f.sub.0 frequency.  For another embodiment, the distance between points 34 and 35 equals the entire wavelength .lambda.  of the frequency\n",
      "f.sub.0.  Alternatively, the distance between points 34 and 35 can be two or three times of one half of the wavelength .lambda.  of the f.sub.0 frequency.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Similarly, for one embodiment, the tap distance from point 34 to I/O pad 32a for line 38 is equal to one fourth of the wavelength .lambda.  of the f.sub.0 frequency and the tap distance from point 35 to I/O pad 33a for line 39 is equal to one\n",
      "fourth of the wavelength .lambda.  of the f.sub.0 frequency.  For another embodiment, the tap distance for each of lines 38 and 39 is equal to one half of the wavelength .lambda.  of the f.sub.0 frequency.  Alternatively, the tap distance for each of\n",
      "lines 38 and 39 equals n.cndot..lambda./4, wherein n=1, 2, 3, .  . .\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 3 only shows device 32 with encoding circuit 32b and device 33 with decoding circuit 33b.  In practice, each of devices 32 and 33 may include an encoding circuit like encoding circuit 32b and a decoding circuit like decoding circuit 33b\n",
      "coupled to its respective one of I/O pads 32a and 33a.  In this case, when device 32 is sending data, its encoding circuit is activated.  When device 32 is receiving data, its decoding circuit is activated.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 4 shows the process of accomplishing termination-less and reflection-less data transmission system 30 of FIG. 3.  As can be seen from FIG. 4, the process starts at step 50, at step 51, the data transfer rate f.sub.D along transmission line\n",
      "31 is determined.  Then the wavelength .lambda.  is calculated based on the data rate f.sub.D at step 52.  For one embodiment, the wavelength .lambda.  is approximately equal to ##EQU1## wherein C is the propagation speed of an electrical signal (i.e., C\n",
      "equals 2.998.times.10.sup.8 miles/sec.) and .epsilon..sub.r is the dielectrical constant which depends on transmission media.  For another embodiment, the wavelength .lambda.  is approximately equal to ##EQU2## wherein .beta.  is selected from a range of\n",
      "0.4 to 0.5 and .epsilon..sub.r is the dielectrical constant which depends on transmission media.\n",
      "<br/><br/>At step 53, devices 32 and 33 are connected to transmission line 31 at one half of the wavelength .lambda..  Alternatively, devices 32 and 33 can be spaced at other non-zero integer times of one half of the wavelength, as described above.  Then\n",
      "the process moves to step 54 at which data transmitted from device 32 are encoded in encoding circuit 32b using the memory encoding scheme of the present invention to concentrate signal energy of the data to be transmitted along transmission line 31\n",
      "substantially around the f.sub.0 frequency.  By doing this, signal reflections along termination-less transmission line 31 can be canceled.  The process then ends at step 55.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring to FIGS. 5, 6A-6D, and 7, the memory encoding scheme employed by encoding circuit 32b (FIG. 3) is described.  FIG. 5 shows the state diagram of the memory encoding scheme, wherein each transition between states is represented by a solid\n",
      "line if a logical one is to be encoded and a dashed line if a logical zero is to be encoded.  FIGS. 6A through 6D show the waveforms of encoding signals S.sub.1 (t) through S.sub.4 (t).  FIG. 7 shows an example of data encoded using the memory encoding\n",
      "scheme of FIGS. 5 through 6D.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring to FIGS. 5, 6A-6D, and 7, the memory encoding scheme is further described in connection with an example shown in FIG. 7.  As shown in FIG. 7, the encoding starts at timing t.sub.0.  At this time, the value of its previous bit equals \"0\"\n",
      "and the value of the data bit is \"0\".  This causes the data bit to be encoded by the S.sub.4 (t) as the encoding moves from the state \"S.sub.1 \" to the state \"S.sub.4 \" (see FIGS. 5 and 6A).  Then a \"1\" data bit is received which is encoded by the\n",
      "S.sub.3 (t) signal as the encoding moves from the \"S.sub.4 \" state to the \"S.sub.3 \" state (see FIGS. 5 and 6C).  Then another \"1\" data bit is received which is encoded by the S.sub.2 (t) signal as the encoding moves from the \"S.sub.3 \" state to the\n",
      "\"S.sub.2 \" state (see FIGS. 5 and 6B).  Then a \"0\" data bit is received which is encoded by the S.sub.4 (t) signal as the encoding moves from the \"S.sub.2 \" state to the \"S.sub.4 \" state (see FIGS. 5 and 6D).  Another \"0\" data bit is then received which\n",
      "is encoded by the S.sub.1 (t) signal as the encoding moves from the \"S.sub.4 \" state to the \"S.sub.1 \" state (see FIGS. 5 and 6D).  The process then moves on to further encode the data stream as can be seen from FIG. 7.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As described above, the memory encoding scheme described above in accordance with FIGS. 5-7 allows the energy of the encoded data to be concentrated around a predetermined frequency (i.e., the frequency f.sub.0).  FIG. 8 shows the power spectra\n",
      "for the encoded data in accordance with the above-described memory encoding scheme.  The equation for generating the signal energy distribution waveform of FIG. 8 is as follows.  ##EQU3## wherein Q represents energy, f.sub.D represents frequency and T\n",
      "represents period (i.e., 1/.sub.f.sbsb.D).  As can be seen from FIG. 8, the signal energy of the encoded data is concentrated within a bandwidth less than 10% of the f.sub.D data rate.  In addition, the energy is concentrated around approximately the\n",
      "f.sub.0 frequency which is 0.4 to 0.5 times of the data rate f.sub.D.  From system design standpoint, it can be concluded that the energy of the encoded data is concentrated around 0.4 times of the data rate f.sub.D of the encoded data.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Once the frequency f.sub.0 at which energy of encoded data is concentrated is determined, the wavelength .lambda.  of the f.sub.0 frequency is also determined.  This in turn allows devices 32 and 33 (FIG. 3) to be able to be spaced along\n",
      "transmission line 31 (FIG. 3) at one half of the wavelength .lambda.  of the f.sub.0 frequency that effectively cancels any signal reflection along transmission line 31.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof.  It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit\n",
      "and scope of the invention.  The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.\n",

      "utilization in an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>Modem digital networks are made to operate in a multimedia environment for transporting different types of data including pure data, i.e. files of alphanumeric characters, as well as data representing digitized and encoded voice, image, video\n",
      "signals etc. .  . The network should, naturally ensure compliance with a number of requirements specific to each kind of such data traffic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Different techniques have been developed for transporting data from one location to another, such as packet switching techniques where the data is arranged into packets.  Those packets may either be a predefined fixed length, like in Asynchronous\n",
      "Transfer Mode (ATM), or be variable in length, like in a Packet Type Multiplexing (PTM) mode of operation currently used for transporting voice.  The basic aim of both packet switching techniques, is to allow a statistical multiplexing of the different\n",
      "types of data onto transmission links to optimize, as much as possible, use of the available transmission bandwidth.  Consequently, a large number of networks, both public and private, have been developed for transporting those data throughout the world.\n",
      "<br/><br/>On the other hand, the evolution of telecommunication technologies in general, and of packet switching networks in particular, is driven by many factors among which the technology evolution factor and the application factors are worth being\n",
      "emphasized.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As far as technologies are concerned, obviously considerable progress has been achieved recently with the maturing of new transmission media.  High speed rates can now be sustained with very low error rates.  High bandwidth can be turned into\n",
      "profit for long distance networks as well as for high rate local networks.  Universal use of digital technologies appeared within both private and public telecommunication networks.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Due at least in part to the availability of these emerging technologies, many potential applications that were not possible in the past are now becoming accessible and attractive.  In this environment, generic requirements are now expressed by\n",
      "the users, such as:\n",
      "<br/><br/>Improving old applications.  Sub-second response times, which are achievable on low cost personal computers, have raised user expectations so that the lengthy wide area networks response times that were acceptable some years ago are today no\n",
      "longer tolerable.  The user interface can be improved, for example, with fast response full screen applications.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Enabling new applications.  Emerging applications like graphic, image, video and multimedia processing are generating large volumes of traffic.  These new applications, not considered feasible (or even thinkable) not too long ago, are now\n",
      "available and are generating an ever-increasing demand on bandwidth.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Optimizing communication networks.  There is a need for rationalizing the many disparate networks that major users have already implemented.  Investments can be optimized by integrating heterogeneous traffic like voice, video, and data over the\n",
      "same transport facilities regardless of protocols.  On the other hand, users want the opportunity to control their networking cost by choosing among the different price/performance options offered by the variety of vendors and carriers and to maximize\n",
      "their ability to take advantage of applications built on top of disparate underlying network technologies.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Accordingly, there has been an explosion in demand for high speed digital network facilities which is leading service providers to install core backbone networks to offer high speed data transportation facilities to large numbers of heterogeneous\n",
      "users' traffic, possibly through \"access backbones\".  Bandwidth offered through such service providers should be transparent to users and should offer fairly large communication bandwidth at optimal cost.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Service providers are now running or expect to run large ATM core backbone systems for use by users needing to transport data traffic between distant locations throughout the world.  Utilization of ATM core backbone systems makes particularly\n",
      "sense when the users traffic is multimedia in nature.\n",
      "<br/><br/>ATM networks are made to transport fixed length data packets, i.e,. 53 byte long packets having 5 bytes for a packet header and 48 bytes reserved to a data payload.  Different techniques have been developed to convert variable length packets\n",
      "(PTM) into ATM-like fixed length packets that can then be transported throught the ATM core backbone.  These techniques broadly include chopping the PTM packets into fixed length segments, assigning each segment a 5 byte long ATM-like header which\n",
      "enables forwarding the resulting fixed length packets into the ATM core network.  Since most PTM variable length packets will not be a multiple of preassigned conventional length, the last constructed ATM packet from each PTM packet will typically have\n",
      "less than 48 bytes of data payload and will need padding bits.  The padding bits carry no information and are considered overhead, which increases the bandwidth needed for a user's traffic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>For pure data providing fairly long and controllable packets, the added overhead is a relatively small portion of the overall traffic and thus may be ignored.  This is far from being the case for multimedia traffic and more particularly for voice\n",
      "traffic generating randomly distributed relatively short PTM packets.  For this kind of traffic, a method for transporting PTM originating data over an ATM network while minimizing overhead may result in significant savings for a customer leasing\n",
      "bandwidth in a service provider network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Any method which minimizes the creation of overhead can be expected to be welcomed by both the ATM core backbone owner in a competitive service provider environment and by the user leasing bandwidth from such backbone owner.\n",

      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>This invention can be implemented as a method and system for optimizing transmission links bandwidth utilization in an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) packet switching network including switching nodes interconnected by high speed transmission\n",
      "links.  The network is one to be used to transport user data traffic including traffic originally existing as PTM traffic organized as variable length packets.

      "<br/><br/>Represented in FIG. 1 is a service provider's network (an ATM core backbone) including five nodes labeled N1,N2,N3,N4 and N5 interconnected by high speed links L1 through L7, which might be OC3/STM1 type of links.  This network may be used to\n",
      "interconnect users directly or via an access backbone system.  For instance, an ATM data source (1) may be connected to the ATM core backbone directly through node NI while a router (2) and PBXs (3) and (4) providing PTM type of traffic may be connected\n",
      "to the ATM core backbone indirectly through access backbone nodes N'1, N'2 and N'3 respectively.  Obviously, nodes N'1, N'2 and N'3 should provide facilities for converting from PTM to ATM modes and vice-versa.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As already mentioned, an ATM packet includes a 48 byte long data payload attached to a five byte long header.  The header concatenates a 1 byte long Header Error Control (HEC) field to a 4-byte long field mainly devoted to storing Virtual\n",
      "Path/Virtual Channel identifications (VP/VC) parameters used in switching the packet through the ATM network, but including few bits (e.g. 4 bits) for storing Generic Flow Control (GFC) data.  The Header Error Control (HEC) byte covers the entire ATM\n",
      "packet header and is used, in operation, for either single bit error correction or for multiple bit error detection.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Briefly stated, the HEC field value is calculated and recorded in the header when the packet enters the network.  The HEC field value recorded in the packet is cross-checked at a point of exit from the network with a locally recomputed HEC based\n",
      "on the information carried in the packet header.  The notation used to describe the error control is based on the property of cyclic codes.  The elements of an n-element code word are the coefficients of a polynomial of order (n-1).  These coefficients\n",
      "can have the value zero or one.  The polynomial representing the content of a header (excluding the HEC field) is generated using the first header bit as the coefficient of the highest order term.  The HEC field content is an 8 bit sequence representing\n",
      "the remainder of the division (modulo 2), by a predefined generator polynomial, of the product x.sup.8 multiplied by the content of the header excluding the HEC field.  The generator polynomial is defined in International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T)\n",
      "Recommendation I.432 as being x.sup.8 +x.sup.2 +x+1.  At the transmitter side, the initial content of a register of the device computing the remainder of the division, is preset to all zeros and is then modified by division of the header, excluding the\n",
      "HEC field, by the generator polynomial and the resulting remainder is transmitted as the 8-bits long HEC.  Again validity checking may be performed along the data path within the network by cross-checking the HEC received in the packet header with an HEC\n",
      "locally computed using the received header data.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The header contents, and more particularly the VPI/VCI fields, are changed in each traversed node within the ATM network.  To speed up the transfer process within a node, some node architectures include connection tables addressed by the incoming\n",
      "packet's VPI/VCI field content.  The connection tables provide the full outgoing packet header, including not only the new VPI/VCI information but also the precomputed HEC.  The validity checking may then be performed at the final receiving connection\n",
      "end.  For more details, one may refer to the European Patent Application, Publication Number 0000719065, with title \"Multipurpose Packet Switching Node for Data Communication Network\".\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring to FIG. 2, the PTM packet represented there includes a variable length payload with an original fixed length header comprising two control bytes (CB1 and CB2), two label bytes (LS1 and LS2) assuming packet orientation within the network\n",
      "is performed through label swapping, a control byte for conventional Linear Redundancy Checking operations (LRC), and, a variable number of bytes for the user's data.  Such a PTM packet may either be generated by a router (2) (see FIG. 1) or by a source\n",
      "PBX (3) processing essentially voice data.  Transportation of the PTM traffic over the ATM core backbone is conventionally made possible by converting the variable length PTM packets into ATM-like cells/packets.  The conversion may either be performed at\n",
      "an access backbone node (e.g. N'1) or at the ATM core backbone access node (e.g. N1).  Conventional converting methods (e.g. see the above mentioned European Patent application) include splitting the variable length payload into fixed length segments\n",
      "(e.g. 47 bytes long).  Then each segment is used to build an ATM-like cell.  To that end, a cyclic redundancy code checking byte (CRC8) is generated for the given segment and appended to the segment; and an ATM-like header including a 1 byte HEC value is\n",
      "generated to encapsulate the segment (see FIG. 2, step 2).\n",
      "<br/><br/>The last segment (identified by a one bit field in the header) typically needs to be padded with dummy bits to achieve the required segment length (48 bytes long) once a 4 byte long CRC (i.e. CRC32) value covering the whole original packet\n",
      "payload and padding bits have been added.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Padding bits are a waste of network bandwidth.  For fairly long and controllable data packets, as may be the case with pure data PTM packets provided by a router (2), the waste may be tolerable as it is a small fraction of the total data.  For\n",
      "relatively-short, randomly-provided PTM packets (e.g. voice packets), the waste is typically less tolerable as the necessary padding bits can be a greater fraction of the total data.\n",
      "<br/><br/>For instance, assume PBX (3) multiplexes up to thirty one voice channels (each providing four bytes representing 0.5 ms of voice data blocks) into a PTM frame.  The user data payload for each frame may vary between 4 bytes and 124 bytes. \n",
      "Obviously, segmenting and converting such PTM packets into ATM packets, with inclusion of padding bits as mentioned above, leads to a serious waste in overall network bandwidth.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The present invention is a method and system for minimizing lost bandwidth and optimizing ATM network bandwidth utlization, particularly for voice traffic.  The invention can be implemented for existing networks which, from business and\n",
      "engineering standpoints, is highly significant.  The goals are achieved by compressing and reshaping voice packets.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring to FIG. 3.  A conventional PTM voice packet represented as frame (1) includes the two control bytes (CH1, CH2), the two label bytes (LS1, LS2), a one byte long checking field (LRC) and the user data bytes labeled H1, H2, H3, H4,etc.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A working assumption is the control bytes (CB1, CB2) are always the same for a given type of traffic.  The control bytes may be dropped (or transferred into the payload) at the ATM entry node (e.g, node N1 in FIG. 1) and then reinserted at the\n",
      "network exit node (e.g. node N3 for a connection between PBX 3 and PBX 4).  The two byte long field that becomes available can be used for a flag (F) identifying the packet as originating from PTM traffic and a count (CNT) indicating the length of the\n",
      "voice packet.  The LRC is replaced by an HEC field (see frame 2 in FIG. 3).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Assuming the most significant bit of the Generic Flow Control (GFC) field in an ATM cell is used in this invention as a one bit flag (F) (see frame 4), then, both headers of PTM and ATM packet frames match perfectly as far as flag F and header\n",
      "HEC locations within the respective frames are concerned.  In this invention, an ATM packet is discriminated from a PTM packet by the flag value.  F=0 designates an ATM packet while F=1 designates a PTM packet.  The count (CNT) field is used to locate a\n",
      "PTM packet end while an ATM packet end is always 48 bytes after the header HEC.  In operation, one may assume that these PTM header \"compression\" operations are performed in an access backbone node (e.g. N'2), or in a port (e.g. N1) to the ATM backbone\n",
      "network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A further compression of a PTM (e.g. voice) packet is represented in frame 3 in FIG. 3, which is used in the preferred mode of implementation of this invention.  The 2 byte long label (LS1/LS2) is compressed into a seven bit long label LAB which\n",
      "can identify up to 128 connections.  Then the first byte may represent the flag (F) and the label (LAB); the second byte is used for CNT and the fifth byte field is reserved for HEC.  The third and fourth byte fields are the freed for data.  Obviously,\n",
      "one may choose a label of a different length to identify a different number of connections.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Then during operation, the PTM packet delineation state diagram shall match to the cell delineation state diagram as defined in the ITU-T Recommendations 1.432, but for the CNT function meant to localize a packet ending.  Such a state diagram is\n",
      "represented in FIG. 4.  Packet delineation is performed by using the correlation between the header bits to be protected (4*8=32 bits) and the relevant control bits (8 bits) introduced in the header by the HEC using a shortened cyclic code with the\n",
      "generating polynomial (x.sup.8 +x.sup.2 +x+1).  The state diagram loops into three states designated as \"Hunt\", \"Presynch\", and \"Synch\".  In the \"Hunt\" state (40), the delineation process is performed by checking bit by bit, within the header bits, for\n",
      "the correct HEC.  In other words, the HEC is computed sequentially on the incoming bits, starting with the flag F and up to the last bit of fourth received byte, and the system checks for matching with the fifth received byte (i.e. HEC).  Once agreement\n",
      "is found (correct HEC) the method enters into \"Presynch\" state (41) for confirmation by checking packet by packet for the correct HEC over a predefined number of packets.  The only difference between ATM and compressed PTM will then lie in the fact that\n",
      "next ATM cell/packet end is at 48 bytes distance from HEC, while PTM packet end shall depend on the count indicated by the CNT field content.  Both packet/cell end tracking are triggered and differentiated by the flag F value.  If an incorrect HEC (HEC\n",
      "error) is found, the process returns to the \"Hunt\" state (40).  Otherwise it enters into \"Synch\" state (42).  This first predefined number of consecutive correct HECs has been selected to be equal to six in the preferred embodiment of this invention as\n",
      "suggested by the ITU-T Recommendations I.432.  In the \"Synch\" state the packet delineation will be assumed to be lost (HEC error) if an incorrect HEC is obtained a second predefined number of times consecutively.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 5 shows an algorithm for implementing the \"Hunt\" state to search for synchronism assuming a PTM packet (F=1) is being processed.  The received frame header bits are serially fed into Hunt operation (50) for HEC computation based on the above\n",
      "mentioned generator polynomial.  Then, a test for checking with the received HEC field content is performed (51).  In case of negative test, the process loops back to (50).  Otherwise, \"Presynch\" state (52) is entered and the CNT count field content is\n",
      "looked for (53), with counter CNT which is being dynamically incremented.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The system goes then to \"Presynch\" and \"Synch\" algorithms as represented in FIG. 6.  A check on count field content, i.e. CNT, is first processed (61) and as long as the CNT value is not reached, count tracking continues on a byte by byte basis. \n",
      "Once the count is reached, the header is checked for validity (62).  Should the tracked HEC be invalid, the process goes back to \"Hunt\" state (63/50), otherwise it branches to check for \"Synch\" state (64).  In case of positive match, the process goes to\n",
      "step (65) to get the count (CNT) and get the packet accordingly.  Otherwise, should the result of test (64) be negative, the process goes to get the count (CNT) and increase Hit Count (66) and check for six Hit_Counts (67).  As long as six hit counts are\n",
      "not reached, the process continues until six hit_counts to declare \"Synch\" state.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As already mentioned, the invention is particularly attractive because it may apply to ATM core backbones or networks already available in the field.  It is implementable into available network node architectures without a need for redesign of\n",
      "either node hardware or software.  It may be implemented as a Line Interface Card to be attached to any link connected to a preexisting node to be operated in hybrid mode (both ATM and PTM traffic).\n",
      "<br/><br/>A conventional node architecture is schematically represented in FIG. 7.  The network node is connected to both ATM and PTM trunks through a set of receive adapters on receive side and a set of transmit adapters on the transmit side.  Both sets\n",
      "of adapters are interconnected through an ATM Switch fabric which processes ATM shaped packets/cells only.  Since the Switch is made to operate on ATM (fixed length) cells, variable length traffic (PTM) is segmented in the adapters into ATM cells for\n",
      "switching purposes, while the ATM traffic is switched almost directly.  Both are however arranged into a format including, in addition to a conventional ATM-like packet (ATM header (5 bytes) plus payload (48 bytes)), the following information:\n",

      "<br/><br/>In operation, the receive adapter (e.g. on node port) receives PTM or ATM packets and performs a number of operations including: LRC or HEC checking, traffic discrimination and routing.  The first function is meant to check integrity of the\n",
      "received packet header and in case of integrity mismatch, the packet is discarded.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As far as routing is concerned, routing from input (receive) adapter to output (transmit) adapter via the ATM Switch fabric, is essentially based on the label swapping in the packet header, each label designating a node output trunk to reach the\n",
      "next network node over a given path, through table look-up operations.  For more information on this feature, one may refer to European Application, Publication number 0000706297, with title \"Method for Operating Traffic Congestion Control in a Data\n",
      "Communication Network, and System for implementing said Method\"; and the above mentioned European Application, Publication Number 0000719065.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The label swapping operation is summarized in FIG. 8.  The VPI/VCI field content of a node entering ATM packet (81) is used to address an ATM Connection Table (82) which has been set in each node to store the information corresponding to the path\n",
      "assigned to the connections throughout the network defined, for instance, at connection set-up.  The ATM connection Table addressing returns new values for VPI/VCI field (with the corresponding control (GFC) and HEC made accordingly).  The table look-up\n",
      "operation also provides additional information made to enable routing the current packet throughout the switch (e.g. SRH) and associated control data (CNTL).  This information, which \"encapsulates\" the packet header should be removed before transmitting\n",

      "constructing ATM-like cells/packets (94).  But unfortunately padding bits might need being used to stuff the last segment to get again an ATM cell/packet whenever the resulting last segment is not long enough to fill-up the last ATM cell/packet.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To enable control of the traffic flow within the ATM core backbone network, a number of operations have to be performed at both node receive and transmit adapters.  These include for instance, in a transmit adapter, first getting each cell from\n",
      "the Switch Fabric and checking its validity through its attached CRC8 and dispatching the cells based on whether they originated as ATM or PTM traffic (e.g. based on a preassigned bit in the control byte) and based on predefined virtual channel (VCI)\n",

      "For instance, network control traffic may be simply addressed to an appropriate local node.  Also, the routing includes stripping the encapsulation headers from both pure ATM and PTM originating cells.  Finally, and to enable further transmission over\n",
      "the ATM network links, a new segmentation operation is needed to derive ATM-like cells from the reassembled PTM packet.  This last operation (implemented using the conventional AAL5 procedure) means again stuffing the last segment with padding bits,\n",
      "which the present invention avoids to save network bandwidth, without having to modify the above described existing node adapter hardware and software.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To that end, a Line Interface Card (LIC) including a transmission portion (Xmit Adapt.LIC) and a receiving portion (Receive Adapt.  LIC) have herein been added, can simply be attached to the existing transmit and receive adapters as just\n",
      "described.\n",
      "<br/><br/>It is assumed herein that a specific virtual channel (e.g. VCI=33) was assigned by ATM core network management system to PTM traffic at connection set-up time.  Then, as represented in FIG. 10 the transmit adapter LIC section can easily\n",
      "differentiate PTM traffic from ATM traffic based on the VCI identification.  Whenever the VCI field content of a given cell/packet to be transmitted further over the network is different from 33 (pure ATM traffic), the traffic is oriented to the left. \n",
      "Then the flag F (see frame 4 in FIG. 3) is set to F=0 (105), the corresponding ATM cell header error control (HEC) is computed and loaded into the cell header field (106).  Then the frame is sent (107) over the node output line.  On the other hand, when\n",
      "the VCI field of the cell provided by the transmit adapter to the Xmit Adapt LIC, is set to 33, then the corresponding cell belongs to a PTM packet split into ATM-like cells through segmentations made according to the conventional ATM Adaptation Level 5\n",
      "(AAL5) performed in (103).  Then some operations are performed to get the compressed PTM packet according to the structures represented in FIG. 3 (see frame 2 or frame 3).  Accordingly reassembling operations have first to be performed (108).  During\n",
      "this operation, the cells are reassembled into their original packet, along with validity checking for the whole PTM packet through the CRC32 building-up from the cells belonging to the same PTM packet.  Briefly stated, this means that, starting with the\n",
      "48-byte long payload of first segment, CRC32 computation is started.  It is stored as a partial CRC in a local memory control block addressed by a pointer derived from AH header.  This partial CRC is then updated with all intermediate payloads of same\n",
      "PTM packet, down to the last, and then compared with the CRC32 stored in that last cell for validity check of the whole PTM packet processed.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Once the PTM packet has been properly reassembled and all padding bits, if any, have been removed therefrom using the information on AAL5 standard (108) header compression is performed in (109) according to this invention (see FIG. 3, frame 2 or\n",
      "frame 3), with the CNT field written to enable location of the PTM packet ending.  The flag F is set to \"1 \" (in 110) to identify a compressed PTM packet.  Finally, the Header Error Control byte is computed (111) and inserted into the assigned frame\n",
      "field.  The frame is then forwarded to the line via the send device (107), which includes means for performing conventional queuing and thresholding after being stripped from encapsulation header (as required).\n",
      "<br/><br/>In the device (107) the packets (i.e. ATM cells and PTM frames) may be queued into several queues in case of multiple classes of traffic having been defined, e.g. based on priority criteria depending on the type of traffic involved.  While\n",
      "thresholding operations may be performed to comply with each network user's reserved bandwidth.  This criteria may be used to optimize the network operation bearing in mind that each user may apply for a predefined bandwidth depending on its expected\n",

      "<br/><br/>On the node receive adapter side the Line Interface Card receive section (Receive Adapter LIC) is attached to interface between the transmission line entering the node and the conventional receive adapter.  The receive adapter LIC includes a\n",
      "receive section (112).  The receive section (112) fetches the bit stream received from the line and assembles the bits into either ATM cells or PTM frames based on the one bit flag F value.  The receive section operations include therefore a synchro\n",
      "state machine as described above with reference to FIG. 4 through 6 for properly assembling and validating PTM frames; or as described in the ITU-T Recommendation I.432 for operating on ATM cells/packets.  While ATM cells go directly to the conventional\n",
      "receive adapter, the PTM frames are submitted first to header decompression operations (113) and then to segmentation operations (114).  Header decompression is meant to enable recovery of the original PTM packet header, that is: checking then skipping\n",
      "the Header Error Correction byte, getting the control bytes CB1 and CB2 back, expanding the label as required, and then recomputing and reinserting the Line Redundancy Checking (LRC) byte.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To get the control bytes CB1 and CB2, the system may either fetch these back from the payload where they may have been inserted, or reconstruct these based on the type of traffic involved.  For instance, as shown in FIG. 1 the PTM connection\n",
      "under consideration may be between PBX3 and PBX4, thus implying a specific type of traffic, e.g. voice connection traffic in which case the control bytes CB1 and CB2 are defined by International Standards.  They then need no further analysis to be\n",
      "reconstructed.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As for the labels LS1 and LS2, these may either have been left unchanged as in frame 2 (see FIG. 3) or they may have been removed (see frame 3 in FIG. 3).  In the latter case the labels could have been reinserted into the PTM frame payload during\n",
      "header compression, in which case they may now be fetched back therefrom, or they may have been converted into a compressed label (LAB).  To understand the label compression, one may recall the label generation rationale.  In a conventional ATM network,\n",
      "the connections between say PBX3 and PBX4 (see FIG. 1) are either established upon users' requests or under predefined circumstances (e.g. link failure recovery procedure).  On both occasions, a connection path procedure is used to define the preferred\n",
      "path throughout the PTM network trunks and nodes, between the two PBX's.  Then a connection set-up message is forwarded, by a network management device along said path, to reserve the selected path and enable fully defining each required node facilities. For instance, each network node may include a Trunk Connection Manager (TCM) which shall drive the operations performed to define the connections between node input and output channels.  For instance, assuming the path under consideration runs into link\n",
      "5 connecting node N2 to node N3 (see FIG. 1), then node N2 Trunk Connection Manager (TCM2) and node N3 Trunk Connection Manager (TCM3) are both involved in the process.  In that case TCM3 drives the process and assigns the labels which are then stored\n",
      "into those nodes'PTM Connection Tables.\n",
      "<br/><br/>During a label compression operation, several assumptions may have been made.  For instance, since in the preferred embodiment of this invention the required number of connections is limited, then the label allocations in, say, N3, is made in a\n",
      "known range (particularly true for voice connections).  Assuming the least significant bits in the seven bit long LAB field are reserved to LS1, the others to LS2.  Accordingly, in that case the compressed label LAB enables reconstruction of the original\n",
      "labels LS1 and LS2, each one byte long.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The original decompressed header components CB1, CB2, LS1 and LS2 are now available.  A checking byte has to be computed.  According to PTM traffic conventions, this checking byte is computed as a Length Redundancy Check (LRC) byte derived from a\n",
      "modulo 2 sum of the decompressed header components, CB1, CB2, LS1 and LS2.  In fact, these may be simply XORed.  This terminates header decompression operations (113), once the LRC has been inserted in the field freed by the above mentioned skipped HEC.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To recover the original PTM frame, all is that is needed is to reconstruct the original payload.  The operations are obvious.  If some payload bytes (see B1 and B2 in FIG. 3 frame 3) had been transferred into the compressed header, they are now\n",
      "transferred back to their original locations.  On the other hand, if some of the original header bytes (e.g. CB1, CB2, LS1 ,LS2) were transferred into the payload, they shall have been transferred back during the header decompression operations (113). \n",
      "Finally the original frame 1 (see FIG. 3) is obtained.  However, to enable attachment of the Receive Adapter LIC to the existing ATM node architecture, the Receive Adapter LIC must provide ATM-like cells coherent with ATM packets/cells received on the\n",
      "Receive Adapter LIC as provided by pure ATM traffic.  Accordingly, segmentation operations shall be performed in (114), with padding bits if required.  These operations are performed according to the AAL5 standard process as already described.\n",
      "<br/><br/>According to the above-mentioned criteria chosen for the preferred embodiment of this invention, the ATM-like cells derived from PTM traffic after segmentation in (114) are buffered and assigned the Virtual Channel (VCI) 33.  Therefore,\n",
      "discrimination performed in the Receive Adapter Section of the Node between ATM cells derived from ATM traffic and cells derived from PTM traffic is based on VCI value, with those bearing a VCI different from 33 being oriented toward Routing (115). \n",
      "Naturally, it should be understood that prior to any such dispatching, cell validity may have been checked based on CRC8 (see FIG. 9).  CRC validity checking is not represented in FIG. 10.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As for the ATM cells transported over VCI=33, such cells are submitted to AAL5 reassembly operations while the validity is being checked for the PTM packet being reassembled, via CRC32 checking.  This again means, for each PTM packet to be\n",
      "reconstructed, starting with the 48-byte long payload of the first segment/cell provided (114), starting a new CRC32 computation, storing the computation result, as a partial CRC, in a local memory control block.  This partial CRC is then updated with\n",
      "all next intermediate payloads belonging to same PTM packet, down to the last (identified properly), and then compared with the CRC32 stored in the assigned field of last segment, for PTM packet validity checking (116).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Once reassembled, the packets are properly routed (117).  For instance, control traffic may be directed to the current node and be processed accordingly.  As for other PTM origin traffic (e.g. voice traffic), once reassembled and routed, it is\n",
      "again segmented in (118) (e.g. AAL5 segmentation) and processed as disclosed with reference to FIG. 9, which means for instance encapsulation with ATM header, HEC insertion, as well as CRC32 generation/update (due to padding bits).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Finally, for each ATM cell being generated, be it from pure ATM, via routing (115) or deriving from segmentation in (118), a cell CRC8 is generated (not shown in FIG. 10) and reinserted as required.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The above is a simplified version of the Receive Adapter which might also include several improvements like, for instance, a backpressure mechanism to enable further regulating the traffic.  In conclusion, those skilled in the art of digital\n",
      "communication network will appreciate the advantages of the proposed method for optimizing link bandwidth utilization by PTM traffic, e.g. voice traffic.  The invention is fairly simple to implement and is transparent to existing networks.  No\n",
      "modification of hardware or software of existing networks are required since a fairly simple Line Interface Adapter can be installed in existing network node adapters.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The gain in bandwidth obtained when using this invention, may be on the order of 20%.  Assume, as previously mentioned, an existing conventional network with E1 connections multiplexing 31 voice circuits each being assigned 0.5 ms blocks (i.e. 4\n",
      "bytes).  Then a conventional PTM packet will have 4*31=124 bytes, plus 6 bytes for header and trailer, which makes 130 byte long packets.  The AAL5 segmentation operations breaks these into 3 cells.  With cell overhead needed to get ATM-like cells, each\n",
      "E1 connection requires (3*(48+5)*8)/0.5=2544 Kbps.  Also assuming an OC3/STM1 link, with a 149768 Kbps bandwidth, and assuming the network operating between 85% and 96% bandwidth reservation, then the number of E1 connections per OC3/STM1 would be\n",
      "between (0.85*149768)/2544=50 and (0.96*149768)/2544=56.\n",
      "<br/><br/>When using the invention, the voice packet will be 3+4*31=127 bytes long (assuming the header includes, in addition to the payload, HEC, CNT and (F+LAB), each one byte long).  The required bandwidth is now (8*127)/0.5=2032 Kbps.  The number of E1\n",
      "per OC3/STM1, with same bandwidth reservation assumptions as above, becomes between (0.85*149768)/2032=62%, and (0.96*149768)/2032=70%.  In other words, the invention leads to an improvement in link bandwidth utilization between 24% and 28%, which given\n",
      "the bandwidth price rates currently practiced means thousands of dollars per 100 km and per month being saved.\n",

      "<br/><br/>This invention relates generally to network switches and, more particularly, to an arrangement for efficiently interconnecting cards of a network switch.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>A switched communication network comprises a collection of interconnected nodes in which data are routed through the network between communicating nodes.  The nodes may be computers configured as end nodes and intermediate nodes, the latter\n",
      "connecting only to the end nodes or other intermediate nodes of the network.  These intermediate nodes function primarily to provide a switching facility that transfers data among the other nodes and, thus, are generally referred to as network switches. \n",
      "As used herein, the term \"network switch\" includes bridges, routers and other similar intermediate network nodes.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The network switch typically comprises an enclosure having a plurality of connector slots for receiving network cards, such as input/output line cards.  The network cards are, in turn, interconnected by a backplane of wires that is often\n",
      "controlled by a switching matrix to transfer data among the cards.  Typically, the matrix comprises circuitry contained on a switch card that is centrally-located (with respect to the backplane) for receiving and transmitting data among source and\n",
      "destination cards internal to the switch.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The centralized switching matrix may be implemented as a bus, a cross-bar or other type of interconnection of wires, such as a cube.  A bus is a multipoint data path that interconnects more than two cards.  Because multiple cards share a single\n",
      "data path, only one may transmit at a time; this raises the problem of determining which card may transmit at any point in time.  A centrally-located switch card matrix may also function as an arbiter to resolve such contention.  Although an inexpensive\n",
      "solution, this approach provides relatively low performance because it cannot handle significant parallel activity.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In contrast, a cross-bar switching matrix provides a point-to-point connection between a source card transmitting data and the switch card, and a further point-to-point connection between the switch card and the destination card.  Each connection\n",
      "thus requires the establishment of a physical, cross-point path through the switch card that is dedicated solely to the transfer of data between the source and destination cards.  Here, the number of connections increases with the square of the number of\n",
      "cards in the switch; these connections may be large, even where a physical path consists of a single wire.\n",
      "<br/><br/>However, a single wire connection between cards may be insufficient to provide the bandwidth required for relatively high-data rate applications.  In this case, each point-to-point connection typically comprises many wires which, for a\n",
      "conventional network switch, results in a voluminous number of wires in the enclosure.  A very large connector assembly would be required to accomodate these wires at the switch card.  Yet, a typical connector of such size may not fit in the enclosure,\n",
      "thereby necessitating use of an expensive, customized connector.  In the alternative, the connector function must be apportioned onto two or three cards which consumes valuable card space in the enclosure.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A more significant problem with the cross-bar switch may concern its susceptibility as a single point of failure.  That is, loss of a single cross-point path in the switch card destroys the connection between the two corresponding cards, a\n",
      "situation that effectively renders the network switch inoperable.  A solution to this latter problem may be to provide two, redundant switch cards per enclosure, although this is an expensive and complicated option primarily because of redundancy and\n",
      "synchronization requirements.\n",
      "<br/><br/>An alternative to the cross-bar arrangement is the cube interconnect, e.g., the hybercube network.  The hybercube network is typically employed for interconnecting many (N) processing elements in an n-dimensional cube arrangement, where\n",
      "N=2.sup.n.  Here, each processing element is connected to n other elements with the longest communication path from any two elements being n connections.  For example, a 4-dimensional hypercube contains 16 processing elements where each element is\n",
      "connected to four other elements.\n",
      "<br/><br/>According to this architecture, data transfers originating from any source element must expect to traverse 4 \"hops\" to reach a destination: one hop to get into the correct set of 8 elements, another hop to get into the proper set of 4 elements,\n",
      "another to reach the desired set of 2 elements and then a last hop to the proper destination.  Doubling the number of processing elements results in a unit increase in the communication path length.  Furthermore, the cube architecture requires that all\n",
      "processing elements be present to enable such multiple-hop transitions.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The present invention is directed to reducing the number of hops required to efficiently transfer data between a source element and a destination element in a communication network.  More specifically, the invention is directed to eliminating the\n",
      "conventional switching function of a network switch by regulating the flow of data over a configuration of interconnected network cards in a manner that reduces the number of hops needed to optimize data transfer efficiency through the switch.\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>The invention comprises an efficient connection technique for maximizing the rate at which data are transferred among source and destination network elements of a distributed network switch.  Such maximum data rates are achieved by\n",
      "interconnecting the network elements through a mesh backplane comprising a novel arrangement of direct and indirect paths between the elements and thereafter, transferring the data over those paths.  In accordance with the invention, the indirect data\n",
      "path utilizes an additional network element of the switch as a 2-hop relay to provide transfer rate efficiency between the source and destination elements.  Significantly, the arrangement of direct and indirect paths obviates use of a convention\n",
      "switching matrix.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In the illustrative embodiment, the backpane may be a full or partial mesh arrangement of direct/indirect data paths administered by circuitry distributed among each of the network elements, e.g., cards, of the switch.  Data path administration\n",
      "is preferably the result of a transfer rate process performed by the circuitry in connection with a conventional routing algorithm.  That is, the distributed circuitry initially cooperate to establish a direct path for transferring data among selected\n",
      "source and destination cards.  If the data to be transferred exceeds the maximum amount allowable over that direct path, the circuitry further selects an additional network card as a relay for transferring the excess data over an indirect path between\n",
      "the source and destination.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Advantageously, the inventive connection technique eliminates the conventional \"switching\" function of a network switch by regulating the flow of data over a parallel configuration of interconnected network cards selected to optimize data\n",
      "transfer efficiency through the switch.  The novel arrangement of direct and indirect data paths further accomodates both failed and missing network cards in the switch to generally simulate a point-to-point, centralized switch in a cost-effective\n",
      "manner.  Moreover, the geometry of the connection technique defines an asymmetric mesh arrangement characterized by a maximum 2-hop relay traversal between source and destination cards that differs from the conventional cube architecture. <br/><br/>BRIEF\n",

      "<br/><br/>FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of a communication network 100 of interconnected nodes in which the novel connection technique of this invention may be advantageously used.  The nodes are typically general-purpose computers comprising a\n",
      "source node N, end nodes E and a destination node D. Each node is coupled to a respective network switch \"S\" 200, which is preferably a specialized computer that provides a facility for transferring data between the source and destination nodes.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Each node typically comprises a processor element 102, a memory element 104 and at least one input/output (I/O) element 106 interconnected by a bus 110.  The memory element 104 may comprise storage locations composed of random access memory (RAM)\n",
      "devices, which are addressable by the processor element 102 and I/O element 106.  An operating system, portions of which are typically resident in memory and executed by the processor, functionally organizes the node by, inter alia, invoking network\n",
      "operations in support of software processes executing on the node.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the network switch 200 comprising an enclosure 202 having a plurality of slots 210 terminated by connectors 220, each of which is configured to receive a network card.  The network cards consist of a\n",
      "plurality of line cards 300 and a utility card 230, the latter providing maintenance functions and containing timing and storage capabilities.  When inserted into respective connector slots, the cards communicate within the switch 200 by transmitting and\n",
      "receiving data over a backplane 400 of wires interconnecting the connectors.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Illustratively, the switch is preferably embodied as a 16-slot enclosure, although other embodiments may include 8-, 24- or 32-slot enclosures.  A feature of the present invention is the interchangeability of the cards inserted into the backplane\n",
      "400; that is, the same cards may be reused in any of the different slotted enclosures contemplated by the invention.  In an alternate embodiment, the switch may be configured as two enclosures connected in tandem to increase the capacity of the switch. \n",
      "Each of the embodiments may be configured to operate in accordance with the novel connection technique described herein.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of a line card 300 that contains a plurality of ports 310 functioning as edge or trunk-type connectors for attaching to physical communication media (PHYSICAL MEDIA), such as Ethernet, Fiber Distributed Data\n",
      "Interface, Synchronous Optical Network Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and High Level Data-Link Control/Synchronous Data-Link Control format media.  Various data processing communication functions, such as packet-type detection, are performed on this\n",
      "card in connection with a processing element 330.  Alternatively, the line card may be configured to transfer data in accordance with ATM applications.  For these applications, information is transferred in the form of ATM cells, each of which contains\n",
      "data and address information.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In the illustrative embodiment, there are preferably four (4) 625 megabits per second (Mb/s) input/output ports per line card and the inventive distributed switch arrangement preferably supports sixteen (16) I/O line cards.  Accordingly, each\n",
      "card may provide 2.5 gigabits per second (Gb/s) of input/output traffic and the switch may transfer approximately forty (40) Gb/s of data traffic among its ports.  To this end, each line card also contains a connection interface (INTERFACE) circuit 350\n",
      "configured to format data and execute routing decisions for transferring that data over the backplane 400 of the switch 200 to other network cards.  In particular, the connection interface 350 contains the circuitry needed to receive data from the\n",
      "backplane and pass it to the processing element 330, and to receive data from the processing element 330 and pass it over a direct or indirect path of the backplane 400, as described further herein.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring also to FIG. 2, it was noted that a switching matrix is typically employed to control the transfer of data over the backplane 400 and among the cards 300.  Typically, the matrix comprises circuitry contained on a centrally-located\n",
      "switch card for receiving and transmitting data among source and destination cards within the switch.  An example of such a switching matrix is a cross-bar switch that establishes a point-to-point wire connection between the source and destination cards\n",
      "over the backplane.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As further noted, the switch 200 illustratively accomodates 16 connector slots 210.  If the slots are fully populated with cards 300, the cross-bar switching matrix ensures that each card has a direct path to every other card using the\n",
      "point-to-point wires of the backplane.  Ideally, 1/16th of the total traffic bandwidth is allocated between pairs of cards.  This arrangement provides maximum performance for uniform traffic mix through the switch, but results in degraded performance\n",
      "where significant traffic occurs between a specific pair of source and destination cards, primarily because the switching function of the matrix obviates the use of the other point-to-point wires which may otherwise be idle.\n",
      "<br/><br/>It would be desirable to utilize the idle backplane wires in connection with the transfer of data between the source and destination card pair.  The present invention is directed to utilizing these otherwise idle wires and to eliminating the\n",
      "conventional switching function of a network switch by regulating the flow of data over an arrangement of interconnected network cards selected to optimize data transfer efficiency through the switch.  Such an inventive arrangement is shown in FIG. 4.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Specifically, the invention comprises an efficient connection technique for maximizing the rate at which data are transferred among source and destination cards of a distributed network switch.  Maximum data rates are achieved by interconnecting\n",
      "the network cards through a mesh backplane 400 comprising a novel arrangement of direct and indirect paths for transferring data between the cards.  As can be seen in FIG. 4, a source card 402 is connected to a destination card 408 over a direct data\n",
      "path 410; these cards are further connected by way of indirect data paths 420a,b (hereinafter designated 420) and 430a,b (hereinafter designated 430).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Notably, each of these indirect data paths utilize a single, additional network card of the switch as a 2-hop relay to provide transfer rate efficiency between the source and destination cards.  For example, network card 404 is used as a relay\n",
      "within indirect data path 420 and network card 406 is used as a relay within indirect data path 430.  By utilizing a single relay, the inventive technique enables the source card 402 to obtain full bandwidth of the system using a portion of the total\n",
      "backplane wires that is greater than that allotted for each card of the cross-bar switching matrix system.  In addition, the inventive technique eliminates the need for such a conventional switching matrix.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As will be described further herein, the actual number of wire connections needed to achieve full bandwidth performance generally increases at a rate of twice the number of cards (2N) in the box, whereas the centralized scheme increases at rate\n",
      "of N.sup.2.  Thus, in a fully-populated, 16-slot switch embodiment, 32 wire connections are needed, depending upon the particular type of wire used.  It should be noted that the actual number of 20 wires needed will differ among different slotted\n",
      "switches; yet, that number is generally smaller than the number needed for a centralized switch.\n",
      "<br/><br/>For example, if N cards are connected by a plurality of wires, each having a bandwidth of 1 W, then the mesh supports NW/2wires for each card.  If N equals 16, the mesh will support 8 times the bandwidth of a single wire, whereas if N equals 32,\n",
      "the mesh supports 16 times the bandwidth of a single wire.  In an illustrative embodiment, the bandwidth per wire is typically 400 Mb/s, although 800 Mb/s wires may also be used.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The novel arrangement of direct and indirect data paths also accomodates an embodiment wherein network switch cards are missing.  Preferably, the network cards are inserted into the slots 210 contiguously from either end of the enclosure 202, as\n",
      "indicated by the arrows in FIG. 2.  In general, the number of paths needed to maintain a full bandwidth connection between any source and destination card pair declines as the number of inserted cards increases because of the ability to traverse a relay\n",
      "between the pair of cards.  More specifically, in the case of missing cards in the 16-slot switch enclosure, the number of wires roughly doubles.  Therefore, the entire mesh supports NW wires for each card.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Additional wires may be added between cards to ensure that there are sufficient relays in the event one of the inserted cards fails.  For example, to guard against a failed inserted card, forty (40) wire connections may be employed instead of the\n",
      "thirty-two (32) wire connections of the typical 16-slot switch.  Accordingly, the entire mesh supports approximately 2.5NW/2 wires for each card.  In the case where more than one card fails, an additional 0.5x wire is needed for each failed card.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The amount of traffic delivered to the network by an output port of a line card 300 is typically a fraction of the amount of traffic received by the input port.  However, a situation may arise wherein several cards provide significant traffic to\n",
      "the same card for transmission onto the network, resulting in an overload condition.  For example, the amount of traffic accomodated by each port of a card is preferably limited to 625 Mb/s. However, several cards may have data destined to the same\n",
      "output port of a card; in this case, there may be at least 1200 Mb/s traffic on that latter port.  Since only 625 Mb/s data traffic can be delivered by the port, some traffic must ordinarily be discarded.  To avoid this situation, the novel connection\n",
      "technique provides a mesh that supports 3NW/2 wires for each card; this provides sufficient bandwidth to handle a temporary overload condition.  It should be noted that these numbers of wires are \"rules of thumb\" for a 16-slot enclosure; the numbers may\n",
      "vary for other network switches having different slot capacities.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 5 is a table 500 depicting the number of connections needed between cards inserted into the switch in order to ensure access to the full bandwidth of the switch.  As can be seen, many connections, e.g., \"8\", are needed between a first (1)\n",
      "and second (2) card, while fewer connections are needed among the additionally-inserted cards because traffic can be relayed through other cards functioning as 2-hop relays in the switch.  Collectively, these connections provide a novel asymmetric mesh\n",
      "backplane arrangement.\n",
      "<br/><br/>According to the invention, the connection arrangement is configured to maintain a required bandwidth within the switch even if cards beyond a certain point are missing.  Thus, if the switch is fully-populated, e.g., all 16 cards are inserted,\n",
      "only a single connection between each card is sufficient.  But if only 8 cards are inserted into the switch, two connections are needed between the cards and in the case where only 4 cards are inserted, four connections are needed to achieve\n",
      "full-bandwidth performance between those cards.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Although the invention reduces the number of wire connections needed for a fast and efficient distributed switch implementation, it does so at the expense of extensive data path administration of routing decisions.  Because of the fast data rates\n",
      "used in the switch, each network card 300 contains a special interface circuit 350 (FIG. 3) whose functions include rendering forwarding decisions for the data traversing the novel connection arrangement, and to format that data for transfer over the\n",
      "data paths of the backplane 400 to the network cards.  The connection interface circuit 350 is preferably implemented as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC); in accordance with the invention, the ASIC contains interface circuitry that is\n",
      "distributed among each of the network cards.\n",
      "<br/><br/>It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the interface 350 contains circuitry needed to implement the logical and arithmetic operations of rendering forwarding decisions and formating data in order to transfer that data over the\n",
      "inventive arrangement of direct and indirect paths.  The exact circuit configuration of interface 350, along with the exact arithmetic and logical operations performed by that circuit, can be varied without departing from the spirit and scope of the\n",
      "invention.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Included among the administrative duties of the interface circuitry 350 is the assessment as to whether a network card is currently used as a relay.  For a fully-loaded 16-slot switch, all sixteen network cards may theoretically be used to\n",
      "transfer data from a source card to a destination card, i.e., there may be one direct connection between the source and destination, and fourteen indirect 2-hop relay connections between those cards.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In general, a source network card has access to 50% of the switch's resources.  That is, a first source card may use a particular network card as a relay \"half-the-time\" while a second source card may utilize that relay the rest of the time. \n",
      "This arrangement is possible because each relay may simultaneously function as two hops: as a first hop for the first source card and as a second hop for the second card.  A source card may realize these resources by either always using half of the cards\n",
      "of the switch or partially using all of the cards.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Because the interface circuitry 350 is involved in all aspects of data transfer within the switch, they do not contain sufficient buffer capacity to store the data transferred among the cards.  Accordingly, data transfer is \"cut-through\" these\n",
      "distributed switching circuits using a transfer rate process preferably performed by the circuitry 350 in connection with a conventional routing algorithm.  According to the process, the distributed circuitry 350 initially cooperate to establish a direct\n",
      "path 410 (FIG. 4) for transferring data among selected source and destination cards, \"on-the-fly\".  If the data to be transferred exceeds the maximum amount allowable over that direct path, the circuitry further selects an additional network card as a\n",
      "relay for transferring the excess data over an indirect path 420, 430 between the source and destination.  Preferably, the transfer of data over the direct and indirect paths occur simultaneously, although various degrees of overlap and non-overlap of\n",
      "such data transfers are contemplated by the invention.  Similarly, establishment of the indirect data path may occur generally contemporaneously with the establishment of the direct data path.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To facilitate such on-the-fly transfers, each network card is provided with control information relating to the traffic patterns among the network cards.  That is, each interface circuit 350 broadcasts its input traffic over the backplane 400 to\n",
      "every other circuit, and each circuit 350 further executes the same routing algorithm to configure its output ports.  This latter output configuration information is also broadcast to all the network cards so that data may be cut-through the backplane\n",
      "interconnecting the cards.  As a result, the distributed switch behaves like a centralized, cross-bar switch without the conventional central switching matrix since the switching functions are performed by the interface circuits.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In the illustrative embodiment, the backpane may be a full or partial mesh arrangement of data paths administered by the distributed interface circuitry 350.  FIG. 6 is a highly schematized diagram generally depicting a full mesh 600 for a\n",
      "fully-populated 8-slot switch.  It can be seen that the relatively small number of cards increases the number of data paths so that there is generally a 4-to-1 ratio of wires.  FIG. 7, on the other hand, generally depicts a partial mesh 700 with the\n",
      "missing cards denoted by unconnected dots 710.  In the case where cards are missing, the general rule is that the number of wires coupling the remaining cards is doubled.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Advantageously, the invention provides a novel technique for interconnecting cards within a distributed network switch while eliminating the conventional switching function of the switch by performing all transfer functions within the interface\n",
      "circuitry.  The distributed switch invention further eliminates the single point of failure present in the centralized switch.  According to the connection technique described herein, if a card fails only that card (and its relay point) is lost.  The\n",
      "control information provided to the interface circuitry relating to the traffic patterns among the network cards allows that circuitry to detect failure of a card.  Moreover, the geometry of the connection technique defines an asymmetric mesh arrangement\n",
      "characterized by a maximum 2-hop relay traversal between source and destination cards that differs from the conventional cube architecture.\n",
      "<br/><br/>While there has been shown and described an illustrative embodiment for maximizing the rate at which data are transferred among source and destination network cards of a distributed network switch using an efficient connection technique, it is to\n",
      "be understood that various other adaptations and modifications may be made within the spirit and scope of the invention.  For example, although the invention utilizes an additional network card of the switch as an indirect data path to provide a 2-hop\n",
      "relay between the source and destination cards, use of additional relays is contemplated by the invention.  However, in the case of a full, uniform mesh, data is transferred over every path in a worst-case traffic pattern so there is generally nothing to\n",
      "be gained going to, e.g., a 3-hop relay arrangement.  Although the extra connections provided between the cards of a 3-hop arrangement may slightly increase the data transfer efficiency, the complexity of scheduling 3-hop relays, i.e., a source card to a\n",
      "relay to another relay and finally to a destination card, generally outweighs that advantage.  Unlike the single-hop, direct connection arrangement where a significant number of wires are unused for many traffic patterns, the 2-hop arrangement described\n",
      "herein utilizes most of the wires.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The foregoing description has been directed to specific embodiments of this invention.  It will be apparent, however, that other variations and modifications may be made to the described embodiments, with the attainment of some or all of their\n",
      "advantages.  Therefore, it is the object of the appended claims to cover all such variations and modifications as come within the true spirit and scope of the invention.\n",

      "<br/><br/>This invention relates to a method and system for adaptively and dynamically allocating operating bandwidth to Non-Reserved Bandwidth traffic in a high speed-data transmission network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>Modern digital networks are made to operate in a multimedia environment for transporting different types of data (pure data or digitized information signals including voice, image, video, etc) over the same network, while ensuring the compliance\n",
      "with the requirements specific to each kind of traffic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>For instance, one may notice that the information provided by various users can be divided into different types.  These include real-time information (such as voice information) that must be transmitted to the end-user within predefined limited\n",
      "time-delay restrictions, and non-real-time information.  If some real-time information is not transferred within said time delay, it should simply be discarded.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In this case, recovery of the original signal, at an end-user location is made possible to some extent, by providing interpolation/extrapolation techniques, in a data packet transmission environment.  These techniques do provide solutions to\n",
      "overcome the \"loss\" of only a limited number of discarded consecutive packets.  They do not overcome the delay restriction requirement.\n",
      "<br/><br/>On one hand the information may be considered as including : a so-called Reserved traffic information whose transmission must be guaranteed with predefined maximum delay according to conditions contractually agreed upon by both parties, i.e.\n",
      "end-user and network owner ; and a Non-Reserved (NR) information, such as certain control information or traffic of specific sources to be vehiculated over the network with no specific time constraint, but which traffic should be optimized for network\n",
      "efficiency.\n",
      "<br/><br/>On the other hand, one should recall that different techniques have been developed, such as packet switching techniques, whereby the digitized data are arranged into so called bit packets as already mentioned, and circuit switching techniques.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The basic advantage of packet switching techniques as compared to circuit switching techniques, is to allow a statistical multiplexing of the different types of data over a line which optimizes the transmission bandwith.  The drawback of packet\n",
      "switching techniques compared to circuit switching techniques, is that it introduces jitter and delay, which, as already considered, may be detrimental for the transmission of isochronous data, like video or voice.  This is why methods have been proposed\n",
      "to control the network in such a way that delay and jitter are bounded for every new connection that is set-up across a packet switched network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>These methods have been described, for instance a co-pending European Application 94480097.8.  All these methods include, for any end user requesting service or any control data to be transported over the network, establishing a path through\n",
      "network high speed links (or lines) and nodes or ports, with optimal use of the available transmission bandwidth.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Basically, one may allocate predefined bandwidth to Reserved traffic\n",
      "<br/><br/> (including real-time) on the basis of contractually defined parameters, and then allocate whatever is left of the bandwidth to Non-Reserved traffic on a fixed basis.\n",
      "<br/><br/>But, bearing in mind that instantaneous traffic is eminently variable for both Reserved and Non-Reserved traffic, any fixed bandwidth assignment is naturally inefficient as far as the efficiency of global network utilization is concerned.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A first improvement consists in precomputed oversized bandwidth allocation on a source by source basis, with the provision of means for detecting instantaneous congestion occurring within the network and for monitoring some sort of \"slowing-down\"\n",
      "mechanism.  Such a mechanism has already been described in the above mentioned copending European Application as well as in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,280,470.  In the mentioned co-pending application, the slowing-down mechanism is only used to control congestion\n",
      "at the node switching level through management of a switch back-pressure signal.  In the U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,280,470 slowing-down is operated over reserved bandwidths only when congestion is detected in network nodes and no increase is allowed, which may\n",
      "result in low link utilization in case of some sources being non-active.  Accordingly, the data sources are not really taken into account on a dynamic basis.  In other words, the considered prior art system does not provide true dynamic sharing among\n",

      "<br/><br/>While the invention applies equally to both centralized control networks and distributed control networks, the preferred embodiment shall herein be described with reference to a distributed control data transmission network.  Therefore, in no\n",
      "instances should this be considered as implying any limitation to the invention.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Accordingly, FIG. 1 shows an example of a packet switching network with distributed control, (i.e. control at each node of the network), which can be used to implement the invention.  This network includes five switching nodes SW0 to SW4\n",
      "interconnected by high speed trunk lines (or links) (10, 11, 12, 13 and 14).  The nodes can be accessed by access lines (AL's) connected to outside data terminal equipments (DTE's) acting as data sources or destination terminals.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The network control architecture being a distributed one, each switching node is controlled by a control point CP.  All CP's are interconnected via a control point spanning tree (CPST) which provides an efficient means for multicasting control\n",
      "messages between the control points.  When a CP wants to broadcast a control message to other CP's in the network, it sends this message to the predefined CPST switching address, and the architecture provides the means to route this message on every line\n",
      "of the CP spanning tree, and only on these lines.  This architecture also provides the means to initialize the tree address on each switching node, and to automatically reconfigure the tree in case of line or switching node failure.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Each CP includes a cop y of the Topology Data Base that contains the information about the network.  It includes the network physical configuration and t he line characteristics and status.\n",
      "<br/><br/>For every line l in the network, transporting a Reserved traffic, the maximum delay T(n) that can be accepted for a packet with a specified priority, and the level of bandwidth utilization R.sub.-- res(n) on this line are defined and recorded in\n",
      "the topology data base.  This information is distributed to other control points via topology data base update messages (TDU.sub.s) sent over the control point spanning tree whenever required.\n",
      "<br/><br/>For more informations on such a Spanning Tree organization, one may refer to the Copending European Patent Application number 94480048.1, with the title \"A Data Communication Network and Method for Operating said Network\".\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, any source user terminal equipment may request a connection to a destination terminal.  For instance user terminal equipment DTE-A and DTE-B which are respectively connected to the network via access lines AL-A and AL-B, shall be\n",
      "interconnected thru the network with a given quality of service (QoS) specified in terms of a maximum delay T-max and a packet loss probability P-loss, upon DTE-A requesting being connected to DTE-B (i.e. at DTE-A call set-up).\n",
      "<br/><br/>To that end, at the switching node SW0, the control point CP0 first uses the QoS and the traffic characteristics specified by the user (peak rate, mean rate, average packet length) to compute the amount of bandwidth C.sub.-- eq, called the\n",
      "equivalent capacity of the connection to be reserved on every line, on the route or path assigned to the traffic between source terminal and destination terminal, in order to guarantee a packet loss probability P0(n) on this line which is smaller than\n",
      "the loss probability P.sub.-- loss that has been specified for the connection.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Based on the information that is available on a per-line basis in the topology data base, the control point CPO then computes the best route in the network to reach the destination.  To that end, a Path Selection Program first identifies the\n",
      "network lines that are eligible for the route.  If R(n) and R.sub.-- res(n) respectively denote the capacity of line n and its current level of reservation, then the line is eligible if:\n",
      "<br/><br/>it then uses a modified Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the minimum weight, minimum hop count, route from the origin to the destination which uses eligible lines and which satisfies the QoS.\n",
      "<br/><br/>where the summation and product operators are carried over the N lines of the route (n=1, .  . . , N).\n",
      "<br/><br/>For additional information on equivalent capacity and best route considerations, one may refer to the following publications:\n",
      "<br/><br/>R. Guerin, H. Ahmadi, M. Naghshineh, \"Equivalent Capacity and its Application to Bandwidth Allocation in High Speed Networks\", published in IEEE Journal of Selected Areas in Communications, JSAC-7, September 1991.\n",
      "<br/><br/>H. Ahmadi, J. S. Chen, R. Guerin, L. Gun, A. M. Lee and T. Tedijanto, \"Dynamic Routing and Call Control in High-Speed Integrated Network\", pusblished in Proc.  Workshop Sys.  Eng.  Traf.  Eng., ITC 13, pp 397-403, Copenhagen, Denmark.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Now, let's assume that the chosen route to connect DTE-A1 to DTE-B from switching node SW0 to switching node SW4 uses trunk lines 10, 11 and 14 via switching nodes SW1 and SW2 and access lines AL1 on switching nodes SW0 and SW4.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To that end, the origin control point CP0 sends a connection set-up message along the route, a copy of which is delivered to the control point of every switch on the route (e.g. CP1, CP2 and CP4).  This message contains a list of the network\n",
      "addresses of the control points on the route, the list of the link names (e.g. 10, 11, 14) between these control points, the requested bandwidth C.sub.-- eq, the priority of the connection, and a connection correlator C.sub.-- cor which is set by the\n",
      "origin control point CP0 and which is used by all other CP's to uniquely identify the connection.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Upon reception of the copy of the set-up message, each CP performs two basic tasks.\n",
      "<br/><br/>First, the CP checks whether the equivalent capacity of the new connection is still available on the line to the next switching node on the route, and if it is available, it reserves it.  Therefore, the CP checks whether the line is eligible by\n",
      "verifying the first above relation.  If it is, the CP reserves the desired amount of bandwidth on the transmit line for the new connection, accepts the connection set-up, increments the reservation level:\n",
      "<br/><br/>and if this reservation level has significantly changed, it eventually broadcasts a topology data update (TDU) message on the CP spanning tree to inform the other CP's of the new reservation level R.sub.-- res of this particular line.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Second, the CP allocates a new label for the new connection, and sends back this label to the control point of the previous switch on the route, for label swapping purposes.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Accordingly, during network operation, each node n (n=0, 1, .  . . ) Control Point (CPn) periodically, and at call set-ups, broadcasts Topology Data-Bases Updating (TDUs) messages collected by access nodes.  Now, for the purpose of the\n",
      "dynamically adaptive control of the network bandwidth allocation of this invention, the TDU format includes an Explicit Rate (ER) parameter.  Accordingly, as represented in FIG. 1, the TDU format for any link l includes, in the above mentioned TDU\n",
      "messages, the Explicit Rate for link l (i.e. ERl) which ERl shall specify the current available bandwidth on the link l divided by the number of NR connections, and therefore indicate dynamically said available bandwidth to the corresponding Control\n",
      "Points.  This information enables adaptively assigning bandwidth to sources requesting service for transmitting Non-Reserved (NR) traffic, with a full knowledge of the bandwidth currently available on all considered links.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Assuming the traffic to be transported from source terminal DTE-Al to destination terminal DTE-B, through the above mentioned path SW0, 10, SW1, 11, SW2, 14, SW4, then each of these node Topology Data Bases shall have available the Explicit Rates\n",
      "on the node connected trunks.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In addition, the TDU format over link l shall also include an indication of number of Non-Reserved connections on said link l, (i.e. : N.sub.NRl).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Given this information, not only the access node (SWO) Control Point is made capable of defining whether Non-Reserved traffic from DTE.sub.-- A may be sent over the network, but in addition the network organization makes it possible to fairly and\n",
      "dynamically adjust the bandwidth distributed among the link connected Non-Reserved sources in order to minimize data packet loss, without impacting Reserved traffic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Represented in FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing the various devices used within any given node, e.g. a zero including a switching device SW0 and attached Control point device CP0.  The switching device SW0 includes several adapters each being\n",
      "connected to one line or link.  The adapters are labelled Adapter 0, Adapter 1, .  . . , Adapter n. One line may handle up to thousands of connections to traffic sources.  For example, traffic sources labelled 21, 22, 23 are represented attached to\n",
      "Adapter 0.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The data traffic of each data traffic source 21, 22, and 23 is directed to a corresponding traffic source access control unit 24, 25, and 26 respectively.  The traffic access control units 24, 25, and 26 individually send information to and\n",
      "receive information from a connection agent (CA) 31.  Each connection agent; (CAo, CAl, .  . . CAn) is attached to the node Control Point (CP0) to get, on request, link information for local connections attached, from the corresponding Topology Data\n",
      "Base.  Also, as already mentioned, the CPO Topology Data Base gets the Topology Data Update (TDU) messages (e.g. TDU 11, TDU 12 .  . . ) f rom the network links (see FIG. 1).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Represented in FIG. 3 is an illustration of the operation of an Access Control Function (ACF) device 30 and the Connection agent 31.  To understand the operation of this system, one should first remember that the data traffic from any user is\n",
      "organized into packets (or ATM cells herein considered as packets) the transmission of which, over a node output line, is regulated.  Various regulating methods are known in the art.  One of these methods utilizes a so-called Leaky Bucket mechanism.  A\n",
      "leaky bucket mechanism is illustrated in FIG. 4.  The incoming data packets to be transferred are first passed through an admission buffer or shift register arrangement 41.  The transfer from admission buffer 41 to the network line is regulated by a\n",
      "token pool.  To that end, a \"token\" generator is made to generate tokens at a predefined rate and said tokens are stored into a token pool 42.  Then, each data packet to be transferred from the admission buffer 41, to the network, shall request as many\n",
      "tokens as the data packet contains bytes.  Should these tokens be available in the token pool 42, the data packet is passed to the network.  Otherwise the data packet waits until the number of tokens has been generated.  Since the tokens are individually\n",
      "attached to the requesting data packets, the mechanism may be improved to enable discrimination between discardable and non discardable data.  Therefore, at the leaky bucket level, processing discrimination between discardable packets and non-discardable\n",
      "packets can be performed through duplication of the token pool.  To illustrate this, non-discardable packets can be tagged with a green tag and discardable packets can be tagged with a red tag.  Accordingly two token pools are then used, one for \"green\"\n",
      "tokens and one for \"red\" tokens.  Both pools are filled independently from each other.  The green token pool is filled at a\n",
      "<br/><br/> token rate C.sub.-- eq(k) equal to the equivalent capacity that has been reserved for the connection k in the network, or at a token rate MCR.sub.k which is the minimum guaranteed bandwidth for NR.  The red token pool is filled at a token rate\n",
      "R.sub.k,t.  While the computation of C.sub.-- eq is described in the above mentioned references, the adaptive computation of the R.sub.k,t is an object of the present invention.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Discardable data packets may include voice data packets recoverable at receiving end through several known mechanisms, e.g. interpolation/extrapolation mechanisms.  But what is more important for the present invention is that the data packet\n",
      "transfer through the leaky bucket mechanism may be regulated by controlling the token generation rates.  This is why, turning back to FIG. 3, one may notice that the Leaky Bucket 32 of the traffic source access control unit (24) for a data source k is\n",
      "attached to a variable rate token pool 33.  This token pool 33 is also provided with threshold reference indications (a low threshold reference TH.sub.L and a high threshold reference TH.sub.H) to be used for regulation purposes.  The token pool level\n",
      "with respect to these thresholds indicates the measure of utilization and defines whether the token generation rate should be increased, decreased or kept even (i.e. not changed).\n",
      "<br/><br/>For every connection along the path under considered the token generation rate R.sub.k,t is updated by a mechanism.  For instance, a token rate computing device 36 for connection k, updates the token generation at time t by providing an updated\n",
      "token generation rate R.sub.k,t.  This is made possible first through the use of a parameter measuring the utilization on connection k (obtained via token utilization device 35) monitored by the token pool 33 and indicating whether the token generation\n",
      "rate should be increased, decreased or not changed, for instance, based on monitoring the token pool level with reference to TH.sub.H and TH.sub.L.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The information provided by all the token utilization devices, such as 35, attached to the individual local connections of the Access Control Function device 30 attached to the considered access link, are fed into an allocated bandwidth computing\n",
      "device 36 within the Connection Agent device 31.  This computing device 36 keeps tracking the bandwidth currently allocated to each connection k of the considered port.  The computing device 36, in turn, drives a rate updating device 37 controlling the\n",
      "token rate device 34.  The computing device 36, is provided, upon request, with all required Explicit Rates (ER.sub.l) and numbers of Non-Reserved connections (N.sub.NRl) available in the Topology Data Base as updated by the various TDU.sub.S) fed into\n",
      "the considered node Control Point (e.g. CP0) to enable computing the updated token generation rate R.sub.l,k,t to be assigned to the connection k on link l at time t, and then drive the token rate device 34.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, the system gets periodically leaky bucket measures and is able to decide if a connection needs its rate to be increased (i) decreased (d), or kept even (i.e. unchanged) (e).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Let L.sub.k be the set of links along the path of connection k. To determine the rate allowed to the connection k of the local port (e.g. SWO for DT.sub.-- A) one first needs to know the portion B.sub.l,t of the bandwidth allocated to all the\n",
      "connections of the port, for every link l belonging to L.sub.k along their path.  B.sub.l,t is given by: ##EQU1## wherein N.sub.l is the number of Non-Reserved connections attached to the local port that have link l in their path\n",
      "<br/><br/>ER.sub.l is the explicit rate for link l;\n",
      "<br/><br/>(Rho).sup.res.sub.l,t is the bandwidth ratio used by reserved traffic on link l at time t, statistically monitored on the network nodes considered.\n",
      "<br/><br/>C.sub.l is the link l speed\n",
      "<br/><br/>N.sub.NRl is the total number of Non-Reserved connections within the network that have link l on their path.\n",
      "<br/><br/>MCR.sub.k is the fraction of bandwidth \"reserved\" for Non Reserved traffic of connection k. (even though this parameter MCR.sub.k should be null for Non-Reserved traffic, one may optionally reserve a fair minimum bandwidth anyway, for that\n",
      "traffic).  In other words ##EQU2## would be the sum of the Minimum Cell Rates (MCR) (if any) of all Non-Reserved connections sharing link l.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Then, using the leaky bucket measurements for the local node at time t-1, the new explicit rates R.sub.k,t for sources attached to this node should be computed for time t.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Using information from the leaky bucket, the system can deduce the number N.sup.(i).sub.l,t of connections bottlenecked asking for more bandwidth, N.sup.(d).sub.l,t from connections which do not use all their bandwidth and therefore can release\n",
      "some of it, N.sup.(e).sub.l,t of connections which use the bandwidth they need and do not need more (N.sub.l =N.sup.(i).sub.l,t +N.sup.(d).sub.l,t +N.sup.(e).sub.l,t).  Note that this classification based on whether the rate of connection k should be\n",
      "increased, decreased or unchanged only depends on the current value set at the local node, R.sub.k,t-1.\n",
      "<br/><br/>For a given connection k, we will use the current rate R.sub.l,k,t-1 set on link l at time t-1 and re-write R.sub.l,k,t-1 as R.sup.(d).sub.l,k,t-1 if connection k needs a decrease, R.sup.(i).sub.l,k,t-1 if connection k needs an increase and\n",
      "R(e)l,k,t-1 if connection k can be held to its current rate.  The computation of the rates R.sub.l,k,t is done according to the following recurrent system on every link l of Lk: ##EQU3## where .alpha.'.sub.l,t and .alpha.\".sub.l,t are multiplicative\n",
      "decrease factors and .beta.'.sub.l,t and .beta.\".sub.l,t are additive increase factors.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The rate of connection k is then set to the minimum rate computed along its path: ##EQU4## and then,\n",
      "<br/><br/>The underlying assumption for this model is that all connections should be able to release at any time the bandwidth they got in order to satisfy a defined fairness criterion.  For instance, if at an arbitrary time there are only connections\n",
      "which ask for an increase and connections which are \"ok\", it is not fair that this state for the previous system be stable some of the bandwidth allocated to the connections \"ok\" should be re-distributed among the bottlenecked connections.  The fairness\n",
      "criterion chosen here means that a state where all connections need more bandwidth than the network can offer is a more fair state than the unbalanced state mentioned here above.  This is, naturally, but one of the fairness criterion which could be used.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The sum term in the equation for connections which need more bandwidth is also used to achieve some fairness among them.  Without this term (i.e., simply using R.sup.(i).sub.l,k,t-1), connections which already have a significant amount of the\n",
      "total bandwidth and ask for more will never release part of what they got in favor of connections with small rates which suddendly ask for bandwidth.  As this scenario is not fair, the global bandwidth of connections waiting for an increase should be\n",
      "equally redistributed (according to the max-min criterion).\n",
      "<br/><br/>At last, the term B.sub.l,t /B.sub.l,t-1 equally distributes over all connections the variations of the available bandwidth for non reserved traffic on link l.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The problem for computing .alpha.'.sub.l,t, .alpha.\".sub.l,t, .beta.'.sub.l,t and .beta.\".sub.l,t is not simple, as they are function of one or more of the time variables N.sup.(i).sub.l,t, N.sup.(d).sub.l,t, N.sup.(e).sub.l,t.  As a consequence,\n",
      "they are themselves functions of time.  Moreover, these parameters should always satisfy, for link l, that ##EQU5## The resolution of the system being too complex to be evaluated for each time t, an heuristic approach should be employed:\n",
      "<br/><br/>For connections which should decrease, .alpha.'.sub.l,t is less than one and should be closer to 0 as the number of connections which need bandwidth is high.  Some of the bandwidth released should also be added to connections which need no\n",

      "<br/><br/>On the other hand, the rate of these connections grows up by applying N.sup.(i).sub.l,t N.sup.(e).sub.l,t /N.sup.2.sub.l on connections which release bandwidth.\n",

      "<br/><br/>The present invention generally relates to multimedia networks and more particularly to a packet/cell queueing and transmission scheduling system for transmitting packets from applications of different types over the same network components,\n",
      "according to multiple criteria in order to ensure a suitable quality of service for a wide range of applications.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND ART\n",
      "<br/><br/>The emergence of high speed networking technologies such as ATM cell-based technology, now makes possible the integration of multiple types of traffic like speech, video and data over the same communication network.  The communication circuits\n",
      "which may be shared in such network include transmission lines, program controlled processors, nodes or links, and data or packets buffers.  An access node in such network should thus be designed for supporting the access of the user existing\n",
      "communication equipments with their corresponding protocols such as X.25, APPN, FDDI .  . . as well as for accommodating new equipment supporting ATM.  Accordingly, it is essential to know the different requirements of each traffic in order to optimize\n",
      "the different processes.  Real-time traffics have more constraining requirements than non-real-time ones i.e. end-to-end delays and jitters.  It is necessary to be able to give priority to the real-time packets in order to minimize these delays. \n",
      "Meanwhile, the packet loss must be guaranted both for real-time and non-real-time applications which have reserved bandwidth in the network, while it is not mandatory for non-reserved type of traffic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Therefore, it is important to provide the network components (i.e. nodes or links) with mechanisms that control the priority of the packets, and process them in order to guarantee the desired quality of service (QOS) to their corresponding\n",
      "connections.  It is also important to offer the same service to connections having the same QOS requirements by providing them with a fair share of the network transmission capacities.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another important objective in multimedia networks is to simplify the configuration and the management of the networks.  One common case is to provide a certain flexibility in the definition of the connections by allowing a connection to send a\n",
      "certain amount of excess traffic over the network.  This provides an error margin in the network configuration and allows a better resources utilization.  In the other hand, well-behaved connections whose traffic profile remains within their contract\n",
      "(based on traffic descriptors) should not suffer from misbehaving connections that send excess traffic.  Therefore, the behaviour of a connection that is, the adequacy between the connection's traffic contract and its actual traffic, appears to be also\n",
      "an important criterion to take into account when controlling the transmission of data over the network links.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Traditionally in high speed networks based on bandwidth reservation, there are dedicated functions generally called buffer management and scheduling functions implemented at node or trunk level, and which are responsible for transmitting the\n",
      "packets from one node to another while ensuring that each connection gets the quality of service it has been guaranteed.  In a multimedia network that handles data of multiple traffic profiles, a proper buffer management and packet transmission scheme is\n",
      "mandatory for ensuring efficiently the connections' quality of service.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In the prior art, there are many implementations of buffer management and transmission scheduling schemes.  Some rely on priority scheduling (e.g. real-time, non-real-time queueing), which resides in implementing priority queues at link level and\n",
      "scheduling the transmission of packets with regard to the priority of the queue from which they originate.  With this type of transmission scheme, a connection that sends low priority traffic would be penalized if it shares the (virtual) channel with\n",
      "connections that send high priority traffic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Other transmission scheduling techniques rely on a so-called fairness among connections.  Generally, one queue per connection is implemented and a scheduler transmits packets from the queues in a fair way, using for example a known round-robin\n",
      "scheduler.  With this type of scheme, the traffic profile of a connection (e.g. real-time, non-real-time) is usually not considered, which may raise problems of QOS guarantee when connections send traffic of different types.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Typically, transmission scheduling schemes do not use the behaviour of a connection as transmission criterion.  This aspect is generally treated by the network congestion control function and more particularly by the traffic policing process\n",
      "which is typically performed at the network access points.  One well-known congestion preventive rate-based access control technique is based on the so-called buffered leaky bucket scheme.  Some of these leaky bucket congestion control schemes involve\n",
      "the marking of packets entering the network: packets are marked with one of two \"colors\", red and green.  Green packets represent traffic that is within the connection's reserved bandwidth, and are guaranteed a prespecified grade of service based on some\n",
      "level of delay and loss probability within the network.  Red packets, on the other hand, represent traffic sent over and above the reserved rate and can be viewed as an emergency relief mechanism coming to play during an overload period where the\n",
      "instantaneously offered traffic is above the reserved bandwidth.  In other words, the amount of traffic in excess of the allocated bandwidth is marked red and sent into the network, instead of being dropped at the source.  Red packets allow a source to\n",
      "exploit any unused network bandwidth in order to improve the efficiency of the statistical multiplexing.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Therefore, In multimedia networks, a queueing and transmission scheduling system that provides fairness among connections as well as relying on connections priority and behaviour would ensure more efficiently that each connection gets the quality\n",
      "of service (QOS) it has been guaranteed whatever its traffic profile is.  Accordingly, the invention described herein relates to a queueing and scheduling mechanism for transmitting packets sent on a transmission medium in a multimedia network node, and\n",
      "is particularly concerned with effectively providing a suitable quality-of-service for a wide range of traffic applications.\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a switching node in a multimedia network that includes a flexible and efficient packet queueing and transmission scheduling system and method.\n",

      "<br/><br/>Referring to FIG. 1 there is shown a typical high speed packet/cell switching network wherein connected user applications generate different types of traffic over the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Network 100 comprises four access switching nodes 101 to 104, and two internal switching nodes 105, 106.  Network nodes are interconnected by network links e.g. 107, also referred to as trunks.  A router 110 transmits LAN (local area network)\n",
      "batch traffic in IP (Internet Protocol) format at a rate of 512 Kbps (thousands bits per second) over the network, via access node 101.  A host computer 111 sends SNA (Systems Network Architecture) traffic at a rate of 64 Kbps to network access node 102. Attached to access node 103 is a Frame Relay Access Device (FRAD) 112 for transmitting voice or video data over the network.  With such different applications sending traffic over the network, it is then usual in such network that a switching node\n",
      "transmits data from connections having different traffic profiles.  In FIG. 1, access node 104 outputs data over the same external 64 Kbps transmission line, from connections originating from router 110 (IP data), from Host computer 111 (SNA data), and\n",
      "FRAD 112 (voice data).  Thus, the difficulty for such network is to provide each connection with the pre-specified quality of service (QOS).  Indeed, some connections are very delay-sensitive, such as voice or video; other are not sensitive to delays but\n",
      "require a very low packet/cell loss in order to behave correctly, with limited retries.  In the network example of FIG. 1, the problem posed is as follows.  Access node 104 transmits on a common output line, mixed data originating from the three\n",
      "pre-cited connections.  As the \"IP device\" 110 sends data over the network at an access rate 512 Kbps which is high in comparison with the others, a great amount of packets (herein \"packet\" designates interchangably packet or cell) are sent to output\n",
      "access node 104 in a short period of time and are enqueued there, in the only queue 108 that is typically available for all the incoming traffic.  As the output line has a lower rate (64 Kbps), a great number of IP packets are enqueued before they are\n",
      "transmitted.  In the other hand, packets from other connections entering the network at a \"regular\" rate (64 Kbps) will also be enqueued in output access node 104, and as there is only one output queue 108 for all traffic, packets from these connections\n",
      "will be \"embedded\" in numerous \"IP\" packets.  This induces significant delays between packets from these connections when transmitted in the output line.  Due to these delays, the transmission quality is corrupted and for connections transmitting\n",
      "interactive data such as in SNA communication or real time traffic such as speech, this may cause active connections to fall.  As illustrated with this example, it is then necessary to differentiate packets based on their connection traffic profile, and\n",
      "schedule their transmission in such a way connections QOS requirements are satisfied.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring now to FIG. 2, there is shown a switching node which can be either an access node or an internal node of the network.  Communication to the node is accomplished by means of adapters components 220 which connect communication lines 250. \n",
      "Switching fabric 210 connects the various adapters at very high speed.  Each adapter connects on one side to external lines via line interface couplers (LICs) 260 and on the other side to one port (270) of the cell/packet switch 210.  Packets are\n",
      "received over the external lines 250, either a trunk i.e. an internal link or a port i.e. a network access link.  Each of these packets is associated with one network connection which is either starting, transiting or terminating in this node. \n",
      "Accordingly, adapters can be of two different types, that is, access adapters or transit adapters.  Access adapters establish data communication from outside to inside the network, i.e. from network attached data terminal equipments (DTEs) to network\n",
      "access nodes.  Transit adapters, in the other hand, ensure data transmission between nodes inside the network.  Each adapter, whether access or transit adapter, includes two parts: a receive part 230 and a transmit part 240.  Receive part 230 receives\n",
      "data flow entering the node while transmit part 240 outputs data flow from the node towards another node (the next node of the path) or to a destination DTE, via comunications lines 250.  Access adapters also support the task of call admission control,\n",
      "that is, the process of analysing the parameters of a new connection in order to decide whether the connection should be accepted or not, taking into consideration the availability of the network's resources.  Another important task performed by access\n",
      "adapters in their receive part, is to control the entering flow from a connection and policing the traffic in function of its compliance to the connection agreed-to traffic descriptors.  This policing function comprises marking packets, as excess (red\n",

      "<br/><br/>Referring to FIG. 3, there is shown the main queueing points of an adapter in a switching node.  In adapter 220, four queueing points can be identified, two (330, 340) are located at the transmit part 240 of the adapter, and two others (310, 320)\n",
      "are located at the receive part 230 of the adapter.  On adapter receive part 230, once a packet has been received from one of the output lines 250, a receive process 360 is performed.  Such a receive process 360 includes connection policing, routing,\n",
      "statistics updates, CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Checksum) checking.  Depending on the architecture of the adapter, the receive process is implemented by means of a specific hardware logic, or through a processor enabled software.  The software solution\n",
      "provides more flexibility, but it is generally less efficient in terms of speed than the specific hardware solution, and consequently a queue 310 may be implemented for queueing incoming packets arriving faster than they can be processed by receive\n",

      "negligeable as switches are generally designed to operate faster than adapters.  Now regarding the adapter transmit side, a packet that passes from switch 210 to adapter transmit part 240, is firstly queued in switch output queue 330 before it is\n",
      "processed in transmit process element 350.  Transmit process element 350 determines the destination output line (250) to transmit packets over.  Queue 330 is thus intended to compensate for a lower processing rate of transmit process 350 compared to the\n",

      "<br/><br/>Referring to FIG. 4, there is shown a simplified schematic illustrating one aspect of the transmission scheduling system of the present invention.  The system comprises as many queues 410 as connections established to the transmit part of the\n",
      "adapter.  Then connections are grouped in function of their QOS characteristics i.e. their priority class, in priority groups 420.  This grouping is actually achieved by queueing the connection identifiers from connections belonging to the same priority\n",

      "the highest priority.  A round-robin (RR) scheduler (i.e. queue) 430 exists for each priority group for dequeueing packets from the connections queues belonging to a same priority class in a round-robin manner, assigning the same weight to each\n",
      "connection.  Alternatively, a different weight could be assigned to connections of a same priority class, so as to implement a so-called weighted fair scheduling.  Then, a higher level scheduler also called general scheduler (not represented) schedules\n",
      "the transmission of packets over the output lines, starting with the highest priority round-robin scheduler i.e. RR for priority N, and staying blocked on it as long as there are packets queued in the corresponding connections queues.  When there is no\n",

      "packets for transmission from connection queues is scheduled given the priority class and the behaviour classification of the connections.  Prioritization for dequeuing connection queues is implemented as follows.  Higher priority connections have\n",
      "priority over lower priority connections.  Furthermore, within a given priority group of connections, non-excess connections have priority over excess connections.  Finally, fairness is achieved when scheduling transmission of packets from connections\n",
      "having identical priority and behaviour.  In addition, a dynamic priority coupling mechanism is provided to prevent excess higher priority traffic from blocking non-excess lower priority traffic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>While the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with variations and modifications.  Therefore, it is intended that the appended claims shall be\n",
      "construed to include both preferred embodiments and all variations and modifications thereof that fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.\n",

      "<br/><br/>The emergence of high speed/bandwidth networking technologies now makes possible the integration of multiple types of traffic like speech, video and data over the same communication network.  The end user applications that generate such different\n",
      "types of traffic, while using the same transmission media of the network, i.e. nodes and transmission links, have different requirements regarding the transmission characteristics over the network.  These applications requirements, commonly called\n",
      "quality of service (QoS) requirements, are taken into account during the path selection process.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The role of the path selection process is to determine optimum paths for user applications across the network each time a connection is requested, commonly referred to as call setup.  This implies the allocation of network resources to users in\n",

      "connection.  The path selection algorithm uses data describing the current traffic load in the entire network.  Such data are stored in a topology database located in each input node of the network.  If no suitable paths can be found that meet all the\n",
      "requirements, the connection is rejected.  Once the origin node has found a suitable path, a setup message is generated which traverses the selected route, updating the resource allocations for each link visited by the setup message.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The quality of service can be defined as a set of measurable quantities that describe the user's perception of the service offered by the network like the connection setup delay, the connection blocking probability, the loss probability, the\n",

      "<br/><br/>The present application focuses on end-to-end transit delay (hereinafter referred also to as EED) estimation.  At each connection setup, during path selection, an estimation of the EED is computed for each path selected.  The precision of the\n",

      "<br/><br/>In brief, according to the invention this object is achieved by providing a network node for a packet switched communication network, the node having at least one input and at least one output with a queuing delay associated with passage of a\n",
      "packet from one input to one output.  The node is characterised in that it comprises logic arranged to provide an estimation of the queuing delay for use in connection routing or other purposes, the estimated queuing delay being such that there is a\n",
      "selected probability for packets to experience a queuing delay larger than the estimated queuing delay based on an approximated probability distribution for packet transmission times through the node.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Another aspect of the invention provides a method for estimating the end-to-end delay of a path comprising N nodes from an origin node to a destination node in a communication network.  The method is characterised in that it comprises the\n",
      "following steps of:\n",
      "<br/><br/>a) computing for each node along said path an estimated queuing delay;\n",
      "<br/><br/>b) combining for each node of the path said estimated queuing delay with the propagation time of the link that connects said each node to the next node of said path to provide a second delay value associated with said each node;\n",
      "<br/><br/>c) combining all said second delay values to provide an estimation of the end-to-end delay of said path.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The method of the invention is much more accurate than the common approach of \"sum of max delay per node\", because it relies on a probabilistic approach.  Furthermore this method allows a computation of the end-to-end delay which is adaptive to\n",
      "the class of service requested e.g. real-time, non real-time, by selecting accordingly a probability value which drives the queuing delay per node calculation.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Preferably the method comprises the step of computing an approximate of the convolution function of the queuing delays associated with each node of the path. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n",
      "<br/><br/>An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:\n",

      "<br/><br/>FIG. 1 represents a packet/cell switching network 100 wherein the invention could be implemented.  This network is represented as including three intermediate nodes labelled Node 1, Node 2 and Node 3, and at the edge of the network, two access\n",
      "nodes labelled Node A and Node B. These nodes are interconnected by links or trunks labelled TK1, TK2, etc .  . . As an illustration, a PBX(A) is connected to Access Node A while a secondary packet switching network is attached to Access Node B. If a\n",
      "connection is requested from Access Node A to Access Node B the path selection process is operated in Node A by a specific adapter called Control Point.  The path selection process will compute the end-to-end delay for all the paths available from Node A\n",
      "to Node B, until a path corresponding to the QoS requirements is found.  In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the path selection process is a broadcast process, which is \"artificially\" spread from one node to all its neighbours (the process\n",
      "remains local to the topology database) until the destination is reached.  In this case, naturally, the path which minimizes the number of hops is discovered first, and then chosen if it complies with the connection requirements.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The computation of the end-to-end delay can be improved in two ways:\n",
      "<br/><br/>The delay inside a node of a considered path should not be anymore the maximum delay (i.e. the maximum queuing time) but a delay quantile, that is, a delay value for which the probability to observe a delay higher than this value is considered as\n",
      "being small enough.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The arithmetic sum of the delays per node along the path should be replaced by a probability convolution which theorically provides the best realistic estimation of the end-to-end delay value.  To that end, a method to estimate this probability\n",
      "convolution is provided.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In FIG. 2, a switching node 200 with its main queuing points is shown.  The switching node considered is based on a switching element 201 with output queuing, i.e. there is no spacing of the traffic in the link adapters 202 of the receiving part\n",
      "of the switch.  The main queuing points are located in the adapters 203 of the transmit part of the switching node, where the packets/cells wait to be transmitted on the output links.  As illustrated by the three queues located inside the output adapters\n",
      "203 and shown in more details in FIG. 3, a queuing and scheduling per priority is shown, in order to minimize delays and jitters for high priority/real time applications.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The inventors have shown, using modeling and simulations, that the probability distribution of the queuing time in this type of nodes can be approximated by an exponential law (the logarithm of the repartition function of the delay probability\n",
      "distribution is linear).  It is then reasonable to compute quantile queuing delays in the output queues using this assumption.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 3 shows a detailed view of the queues within an output adapter 203.  A scheduler 301 ensures the jitters/delays minimization for high priority traffic through the use of queues of different size.  For example, a top-priority queue for\n",
      "traffic with a guaranteed, very short end-to-end delay (real-time traffic).  Assuming that a given queue i has a size of X(i) (in bits), the maximum delay that a bit can wait inside this queue is Qmax(i)=X(i)/S(i), where S(i) is the speed of the link\n",
      "attached to this adapter.  With the assumption that the queue is infinite, the probability to observe a delay that is higher than Qmax is the loss probability .epsilon.  engineered for the considered link.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Let us consider a path of N consecutive nodes i (i=1 to N).  For each node i the path selection process provides a set of values (X(i), S(i)) from the topology database.  As mentionned above, it has been experimentally observed that one can\n",
      "approximate the repartition function of the delay probability distribution at node i by an exponential law, as expressed in the following formula: ##EQU3##\n",
      "<br/><br/>and the corresponding probability density function is as follows: ##EQU4##\n",
      "<br/><br/>where T(i) is the mean delay associated with node i. Given that F(T(i),Qmax)=1-.epsilon., T(i) is evaluated from the maximum queuing time Qmax(i)=X(i)/S(i) and the loss probability .epsilon.  according to the following formula: ##EQU5##\n",
      "<br/><br/>Delay Quantile\n",
      "<br/><br/>Now, one can define the delay quantile at p (p probability) at node i, Tqp(i), as the delay value for which the probability to observe in node i, a delay greater than this delay value is equal to p. This definition can be expressed by the\n",
      "following formula: ##EQU6##\n",
      "<br/><br/>thus, using formula (6) above, one can deduce from (7): ##EQU7##\n",
      "<br/><br/>In the preferred embodiment a 1% (10.sup.-2) quantile is chosen for NRT (non real time) traffic for which the delay constraint is low, while more stringent quantile (e.g. 10.sup.-5) can be used for RT (real time) bursty traffic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Convolution\n",
      "<br/><br/>Considering the entire path of N nodes, calculating a global delay quantile applying to the whole path would imply the calculation of convolution products of elementary repartition functions associated with each node along the path considered. \n",
      "As probability convolution functions are generally heavy to compute, implementing their computation would alter the performance (speed) of the call setup process.  The inventors have found a method to approximate the convolution which is based on\n",
      "simulation results: the computation of an estimate Tconv of the total quantile delay at p of the path considered comprising N nodes relies on the following formula: ##EQU8##\n",

      "utilization in an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>Modem digital networks are made to operate in a multimedia environment for transporting different types of data including pure data, i.e. files of alphanumeric characters, as well as data representing digitized and encoded voice, image, video\n",
      "signals etc. .  . The network should, naturally ensure compliance with a number of requirements specific to each kind of such data traffic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Different techniques have been developed for transporting data from one location to another, such as packet switching techniques where the data is arranged into packets.  Those packets may either be a predefined fixed length, like in Asynchronous\n",
      "Transfer Mode (ATM), or be variable in length, like in a Packet Type Multiplexing (PTM) mode of operation currently used for transporting voice.  The basic aim of both packet switching techniques, is to allow a statistical multiplexing of the different\n",
      "types of data onto transmission links to optimize, as much as possible, use of the available transmission bandwidth.  Consequently, a large number of networks, both public and private, have been developed for transporting those data throughout the world.\n",
      "<br/><br/>On the other hand, the evolution of telecommunication technologies in general, and of packet switching networks in particular, is driven by many factors among which the technology evolution factor and the application factors are worth being\n",
      "emphasized.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As far as technologies are concerned, obviously considerable progress has been achieved recently with the maturing of new transmission media.  High speed rates can now be sustained with very low error rates.  High bandwidth can be turned into\n",
      "profit for long distance networks as well as for high rate local networks.  Universal use of digital technologies appeared within both private and public telecommunication networks.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Due at least in part to the availability of these emerging technologies, many potential applications that were not possible in the past are now becoming accessible and attractive.  In this environment, generic requirements are now expressed by\n",
      "the users, such as:\n",
      "<br/><br/>Improving old applications.  Sub-second response times, which are achievable on low cost personal computers, have raised user expectations so that the lengthy wide area networks response times that were acceptable some years ago are today no\n",
      "longer tolerable.  The user interface can be improved, for example, with fast response full screen applications.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Enabling new applications.  Emerging applications like graphic, image, video and multimedia processing are generating large volumes of traffic.  These new applications, not considered feasible (or even thinkable) not too long ago, are now\n",
      "available and are generating an ever-increasing demand on bandwidth.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Optimizing communication networks.  There is a need for rationalizing the many disparate networks that major users have already implemented.  Investments can be optimized by integrating heterogeneous traffic like voice, video, and data over the\n",
      "same transport facilities regardless of protocols.  On the other hand, users want the opportunity to control their networking cost by choosing among the different price/performance options offered by the variety of vendors and carriers and to maximize\n",
      "their ability to take advantage of applications built on top of disparate underlying network technologies.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Accordingly, there has been an explosion in demand for high speed digital network facilities which is leading service providers to install core backbone networks to offer high speed data transportation facilities to large numbers of heterogeneous\n",
      "users' traffic, possibly through \"access backbones\".  Bandwidth offered through such service providers should be transparent to users and should offer fairly large communication bandwidth at optimal cost.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Service providers are now running or expect to run large ATM core backbone systems for use by users needing to transport data traffic between distant locations throughout the world.  Utilization of ATM core backbone systems makes particularly\n",
      "sense when the users traffic is multimedia in nature.\n",
      "<br/><br/>ATM networks are made to transport fixed length data packets, i.e,. 53 byte long packets having 5 bytes for a packet header and 48 bytes reserved to a data payload.  Different techniques have been developed to convert variable length packets\n",
      "(PTM) into ATM-like fixed length packets that can then be transported throught the ATM core backbone.  These techniques broadly include chopping the PTM packets into fixed length segments, assigning each segment a 5 byte long ATM-like header which\n",
      "enables forwarding the resulting fixed length packets into the ATM core network.  Since most PTM variable length packets will not be a multiple of preassigned conventional length, the last constructed ATM packet from each PTM packet will typically have\n",
      "less than 48 bytes of data payload and will need padding bits.  The padding bits carry no information and are considered overhead, which increases the bandwidth needed for a user's traffic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>For pure data providing fairly long and controllable packets, the added overhead is a relatively small portion of the overall traffic and thus may be ignored.  This is far from being the case for multimedia traffic and more particularly for voice\n",
      "traffic generating randomly distributed relatively short PTM packets.  For this kind of traffic, a method for transporting PTM originating data over an ATM network while minimizing overhead may result in significant savings for a customer leasing\n",
      "bandwidth in a service provider network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Any method which minimizes the creation of overhead can be expected to be welcomed by both the ATM core backbone owner in a competitive service provider environment and by the user leasing bandwidth from such backbone owner.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The present invention focuses on solving the overhead problem created when padding bits are generated during the conversion of variable length data packets into fixed length ATM packets (or cells).\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>This invention can be implemented as a method and system for optimizing transmission links bandwidth utilization in an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) packet switching network including switching nodes interconnected by high speed transmission\n",
      "links.  The network is one to be used to transport user data traffic including traffic originally existing as PTM traffic organized as variable length packets.  Each such PTM packet has a variable length data payload and a fixed length PTM packet header.

      "<br/><br/>Represented in FIG. 1 is a service provider's network (an ATM core backbone) including five nodes labeled N1,N2,N3,N4 and N5 interconnected by high speed links L1 through L7, which might be OC3/STM1 type of links.  This network may be used to\n",
      "interconnect users directly or via an access backbone system.  For instance, an ATM data source (1) may be connected to the ATM core backbone directly through node NI while a router (2) and PBXs (3) and (4) providing PTM type of traffic may be connected\n",
      "to the ATM core backbone indirectly through access backbone nodes N'1, N'2 and N'3 respectively.  Obviously, nodes N'1, N'2 and N'3 should provide facilities for converting from PTM to ATM modes and vice-versa.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As already mentioned, an ATM packet includes a 48 byte long data payload attached to a five byte long header.  The header concatenates a 1 byte long Header Error Control (HEC) field to a 4-byte long field mainly devoted to storing Virtual\n",
      "Path/Virtual Channel identifications (VP/VC) parameters used in switching the packet through the ATM network, but including few bits (e.g. 4 bits) for storing Generic Flow Control (GFC) data.  The Header Error Control (HEC) byte covers the entire ATM\n",
      "packet header and is used, in operation, for either single bit error correction or for multiple bit error detection.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Briefly stated, the HEC field value is calculated and recorded in the header when the packet enters the network.  The HEC field value recorded in the packet is cross-checked at a point of exit from the network with a locally recomputed HEC based\n",
      "on the information carried in the packet header.  The notation used to describe the error control is based on the property of cyclic codes.  The elements of an n-element code word are the coefficients of a polynomial of order (n-1).  These coefficients\n",
      "can have the value zero or one.  The polynomial representing the content of a header (excluding the HEC field) is generated using the first header bit as the coefficient of the highest order term.  The HEC field content is an 8 bit sequence representing\n",
      "the remainder of the division (modulo 2), by a predefined generator polynomial, of the product x.sup.8 multiplied by the content of the header excluding the HEC field.  The generator polynomial is defined in International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T)\n",
      "Recommendation I.432 as being x.sup.8 +x.sup.2 +x+1.  At the transmitter side, the initial content of a register of the device computing the remainder of the division, is preset to all zeros and is then modified by division of the header, excluding the\n",
      "HEC field, by the generator polynomial and the resulting remainder is transmitted as the 8-bits long HEC.  Again validity checking may be performed along the data path within the network by cross-checking the HEC received in the packet header with an HEC\n",
      "locally computed using the received header data.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The header contents, and more particularly the VPI/VCI fields, are changed in each traversed node within the ATM network.  To speed up the transfer process within a node, some node architectures include connection tables addressed by the incoming\n",
      "packet's VPI/VCI field content.  The connection tables provide the full outgoing packet header, including not only the new VPI/VCI information but also the precomputed HEC.  The validity checking may then be performed at the final receiving connection\n",
      "end.  For more details, one may refer to the European Patent Application, Publication Number 0000719065, with title \"Multipurpose Packet Switching Node for Data Communication Network\".\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring to FIG. 2, the PTM packet represented there includes a variable length payload with an original fixed length header comprising two control bytes (CB1 and CB2), two label bytes (LS1 and LS2) assuming packet orientation within the network\n",
      "is performed through label swapping, a control byte for conventional Linear Redundancy Checking operations (LRC), and, a variable number of bytes for the user's data.  Such a PTM packet may either be generated by a router (2) (see FIG. 1) or by a source\n",
      "PBX (3) processing essentially voice data.  Transportation of the PTM traffic over the ATM core backbone is conventionally made possible by converting the variable length PTM packets into ATM-like cells/packets.  The conversion may either be performed at\n",
      "an access backbone node (e.g. N'1) or at the ATM core backbone access node (e.g. N1).  Conventional converting methods (e.g. see the above mentioned European Patent application) include splitting the variable length payload into fixed length segments\n",
      "(e.g. 47 bytes long).  Then each segment is used to build an ATM-like cell.  To that end, a cyclic redundancy code checking byte (CRC8) is generated for the given segment and appended to the segment; and an ATM-like header including a 1 byte HEC value is\n",
      "generated to encapsulate the segment (see FIG. 2, step 2).\n",
      "<br/><br/>The last segment (identified by a one bit field in the header) typically needs to be padded with dummy bits to achieve the required segment length (48 bytes long) once a 4 byte long CRC (i.e. CRC32) value covering the whole original packet\n",
      "payload and padding bits have been added.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Padding bits are a waste of network bandwidth.  For fairly long and controllable data packets, as may be the case with pure data PTM packets provided by a router (2), the waste may be tolerable as it is a small fraction of the total data.  For\n",
      "relatively-short, randomly-provided PTM packets (e.g. voice packets), the waste is typically less tolerable as the necessary padding bits can be a greater fraction of the total data.\n",
      "<br/><br/>For instance, assume PBX (3) multiplexes up to thirty one voice channels (each providing four bytes representing 0.5 ms of voice data blocks) into a PTM frame.  The user data payload for each frame may vary between 4 bytes and 124 bytes. \n",
      "Obviously, segmenting and converting such PTM packets into ATM packets, with inclusion of padding bits as mentioned above, leads to a serious waste in overall network bandwidth.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The present invention is a method and system for minimizing lost bandwidth and optimizing ATM network bandwidth utlization, particularly for voice traffic.  The invention can be implemented for existing networks which, from business and\n",
      "engineering standpoints, is highly significant.  The goals are achieved by compressing and reshaping voice packets.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring to FIG. 3.  A conventional PTM voice packet represented as frame (1) includes the two control bytes (CH1, CH2), the two label bytes (LS1, LS2), a one byte long checking field (LRC) and the user data bytes labeled H1, H2, H3, H4,etc.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A working assumption is the control bytes (CB1, CB2) are always the same for a given type of traffic.  The control bytes may be dropped (or transferred into the payload) at the ATM entry node (e.g, node N1 in FIG. 1) and then reinserted at the\n",
      "network exit node (e.g. node N3 for a connection between PBX 3 and PBX 4).  The two byte long field that becomes available can be used for a flag (F) identifying the packet as originating from PTM traffic and a count (CNT) indicating the length of the\n",
      "voice packet.  The LRC is replaced by an HEC field (see frame 2 in FIG. 3).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Assuming the most significant bit of the Generic Flow Control (GFC) field in an ATM cell is used in this invention as a one bit flag (F) (see frame 4), then, both headers of PTM and ATM packet frames match perfectly as far as flag F and header\n",
      "HEC locations within the respective frames are concerned.  In this invention, an ATM packet is discriminated from a PTM packet by the flag value.  F=0 designates an ATM packet while F=1 designates a PTM packet.  The count (CNT) field is used to locate a\n",
      "PTM packet end while an ATM packet end is always 48 bytes after the header HEC.  In operation, one may assume that these PTM header \"compression\" operations are performed in an access backbone node (e.g. N'2), or in a port (e.g. N1) to the ATM backbone\n",
      "network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A further compression of a PTM (e.g. voice) packet is represented in frame 3 in FIG. 3, which is used in the preferred mode of implementation of this invention.  The 2 byte long label (LS1/LS2) is compressed into a seven bit long label LAB which\n",
      "can identify up to 128 connections.  Then the first byte may represent the flag (F) and the label (LAB); the second byte is used for CNT and the fifth byte field is reserved for HEC.  The third and fourth byte fields are the freed for data.  Obviously,\n",
      "one may choose a label of a different length to identify a different number of connections.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Then during operation, the PTM packet delineation state diagram shall match to the cell delineation state diagram as defined in the ITU-T Recommendations 1.432, but for the CNT function meant to localize a packet ending.  Such a state diagram is\n",
      "represented in FIG. 4.  Packet delineation is performed by using the correlation between the header bits to be protected (4*8=32 bits) and the relevant control bits (8 bits) introduced in the header by the HEC using a shortened cyclic code with the\n",
      "generating polynomial (x.sup.8 +x.sup.2 +x+1).  The state diagram loops into three states designated as \"Hunt\", \"Presynch\", and \"Synch\".  In the \"Hunt\" state (40), the delineation process is performed by checking bit by bit, within the header bits, for\n",
      "the correct HEC.  In other words, the HEC is computed sequentially on the incoming bits, starting with the flag F and up to the last bit of fourth received byte, and the system checks for matching with the fifth received byte (i.e. HEC).  Once agreement\n",
      "is found (correct HEC) the method enters into \"Presynch\" state (41) for confirmation by checking packet by packet for the correct HEC over a predefined number of packets.  The only difference between ATM and compressed PTM will then lie in the fact that\n",
      "next ATM cell/packet end is at 48 bytes distance from HEC, while PTM packet end shall depend on the count indicated by the CNT field content.  Both packet/cell end tracking are triggered and differentiated by the flag F value.  If an incorrect HEC (HEC\n",
      "error) is found, the process returns to the \"Hunt\" state (40).  Otherwise it enters into \"Synch\" state (42).  This first predefined number of consecutive correct HECs has been selected to be equal to six in the preferred embodiment of this invention as\n",
      "suggested by the ITU-T Recommendations I.432.  In the \"Synch\" state the packet delineation will be assumed to be lost (HEC error) if an incorrect HEC is obtained a second predefined number of times consecutively.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 5 shows an algorithm for implementing the \"Hunt\" state to search for synchronism assuming a PTM packet (F=1) is being processed.  The received frame header bits are serially fed into Hunt operation (50) for HEC computation based on the above\n",
      "mentioned generator polynomial.  Then, a test for checking with the received HEC field content is performed (51).  In case of negative test, the process loops back to (50).  Otherwise, \"Presynch\" state (52) is entered and the CNT count field content is\n",
      "looked for (53), with counter CNT which is being dynamically incremented.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The system goes then to \"Presynch\" and \"Synch\" algorithms as represented in FIG. 6.  A check on count field content, i.e. CNT, is first processed (61) and as long as the CNT value is not reached, count tracking continues on a byte by byte basis. \n",
      "Once the count is reached, the header is checked for validity (62).  Should the tracked HEC be invalid, the process goes back to \"Hunt\" state (63/50), otherwise it branches to check for \"Synch\" state (64).  In case of positive match, the process goes to\n",
      "step (65) to get the count (CNT) and get the packet accordingly.  Otherwise, should the result of test (64) be negative, the process goes to get the count (CNT) and increase Hit Count (66) and check for six Hit_Counts (67).  As long as six hit counts are\n",
      "not reached, the process continues until six hit_counts to declare \"Synch\" state.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As already mentioned, the invention is particularly attractive because it may apply to ATM core backbones or networks already available in the field.  It is implementable into available network node architectures without a need for redesign of\n",
      "either node hardware or software.  It may be implemented as a Line Interface Card to be attached to any link connected to a preexisting node to be operated in hybrid mode (both ATM and PTM traffic).\n",
      "<br/><br/>A conventional node architecture is schematically represented in FIG. 7.  The network node is connected to both ATM and PTM trunks through a set of receive adapters on receive side and a set of transmit adapters on the transmit side.  Both sets\n",
      "of adapters are interconnected through an ATM Switch fabric which processes ATM shaped packets/cells only.  Since the Switch is made to operate on ATM (fixed length) cells, variable length traffic (PTM) is segmented in the adapters into ATM cells for\n",
      "switching purposes, while the ATM traffic is switched almost directly.  Both are however arranged into a format including, in addition to a conventional ATM-like packet (ATM header (5 bytes) plus payload (48 bytes)), the following information:\n",

      "received packet header and in case of integrity mismatch, the packet is discarded.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As far as routing is concerned, routing from input (receive) adapter to output (transmit) adapter via the ATM Switch fabric, is essentially based on the label swapping in the packet header, each label designating a node output trunk to reach the\n",
      "next network node over a given path, through table look-up operations.  For more information on this feature, one may refer to European Application, Publication number 0000706297, with title \"Method for Operating Traffic Congestion Control in a Data\n",

      "<br/><br/>The label swapping operation is summarized in FIG. 8.  The VPI/VCI field content of a node entering ATM packet (81) is used to address an ATM Connection Table (82) which has been set in each node to store the information corresponding to the path\n",

      "<br/><br/>To get the control bytes CB1 and CB2, the system may either fetch these back from the payload where they may have been inserted, or reconstruct these based on the type of traffic involved.  For instance, as shown in FIG. 1 the PTM connection\n",
      "under consideration may be between PBX3 and PBX4, thus implying a specific type of traffic, e.g. voice connection traffic in which case the control bytes CB1 and CB2 are defined by International Standards.  They then need no further analysis to be\n",
      "reconstructed.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As for the labels LS1 and LS2, these may either have been left unchanged as in frame 2 (see FIG. 3) or they may have been removed (see frame 3 in FIG. 3).  In the latter case the labels could have been reinserted into the PTM frame payload during\n",
      "header compression, in which case they may now be fetched back therefrom, or they may have been converted into a compressed label (LAB).  To understand the label compression, one may recall the label generation rationale.  In a conventional ATM network,\n",
      "the connections between say PBX3 and PBX4 (see FIG. 1) are either established upon users' requests or under predefined circumstances (e.g. link failure recovery procedure).  On both occasions, a connection path procedure is used to define the preferred\n",
      "path throughout the PTM network trunks and nodes, between the two PBX's.  Then a connection set-up message is forwarded, by a network management device along said path, to reserve the selected path and enable fully defining each required node facilities. For instance, each network node may include a Trunk Connection Manager (TCM) which shall drive the operations performed to define the connections between node input and output channels.  For instance, assuming the path under consideration runs into link\n",
      "5 connecting node N2 to node N3 (see FIG. 1), then node N2 Trunk Connection Manager (TCM2) and node N3 Trunk Connection Manager (TCM3) are both involved in the process.  In that case TCM3 drives the process and assigns the labels which are then stored\n",
      "into those nodes'PTM Connection Tables.\n",
      "<br/><br/>During a label compression operation, several assumptions may have been made.  For instance, since in the preferred embodiment of this invention the required number of connections is limited, then the label allocations in, say, N3, is made in a\n",
      "known range (particularly true for voice connections).  Assuming the least significant bits in the seven bit long LAB field are reserved to LS1, the others to LS2.  Accordingly, in that case the compressed label LAB enables reconstruction of the original\n",
      "labels LS1 and LS2, each one byte long.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The original decompressed header components CB1, CB2, LS1 and LS2 are now available.  A checking byte has to be computed.  According to PTM traffic conventions, this checking byte is computed as a Length Redundancy Check (LRC) byte derived from a\n",
      "modulo 2 sum of the decompressed header components, CB1, CB2, LS1 and LS2.  In fact, these may be simply XORed.  This terminates header decompression operations (113), once the LRC has been inserted in the field freed by the above mentioned skipped HEC.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To recover the original PTM frame, all is that is needed is to reconstruct the original payload.  The operations are obvious.  If some payload bytes (see B1 and B2 in FIG. 3 frame 3) had been transferred into the compressed header, they are now\n",
      "transferred back to their original locations.  On the other hand, if some of the original header bytes (e.g. CB1, CB2, LS1 ,LS2) were transferred into the payload, they shall have been transferred back during the header decompression operations (113). \n",
      "Finally the original frame 1 (see FIG. 3) is obtained.  However, to enable attachment of the Receive Adapter LIC to the existing ATM node architecture, the Receive Adapter LIC must provide ATM-like cells coherent with ATM packets/cells received on the\n",
      "Receive Adapter LIC as provided by pure ATM traffic.  Accordingly, segmentation operations shall be performed in (114), with padding bits if required.  These operations are performed according to the AAL5 standard process as already described.\n",
      "<br/><br/>According to the above-mentioned criteria chosen for the preferred embodiment of this invention, the ATM-like cells derived from PTM traffic after segmentation in (114) are buffered and assigned the Virtual Channel (VCI) 33.  Therefore,\n",
      "discrimination performed in the Receive Adapter Section of the Node between ATM cells derived from ATM traffic and cells derived from PTM traffic is based on VCI value, with those bearing a VCI different from 33 being oriented toward Routing (115). \n",
      "Naturally, it should be understood that prior to any such dispatching, cell validity may have been checked based on CRC8 (see FIG. 9).  CRC validity checking is not represented in FIG. 10.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As for the ATM cells transported over VCI=33, such cells are submitted to AAL5 reassembly operations while the validity is being checked for the PTM packet being reassembled, via CRC32 checking.  This again means, for each PTM packet to be\n",
      "reconstructed, starting with the 48-byte long payload of the first segment/cell provided (114), starting a new CRC32 computation, storing the computation result, as a partial CRC, in a local memory control block.  This partial CRC is then updated with\n",
      "all next intermediate payloads belonging to same PTM packet, down to the last (identified properly), and then compared with the CRC32 stored in the assigned field of last segment, for PTM packet validity checking (116).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Once reassembled, the packets are properly routed (117).  For instance, control traffic may be directed to the current node and be processed accordingly.  As for other PTM origin traffic (e.g. voice traffic), once reassembled and routed, it is\n",
      "again segmented in (118) (e.g. AAL5 segmentation) and processed as disclosed with reference to FIG. 9, which means for instance encapsulation with ATM header, HEC insertion, as well as CRC32 generation/update (due to padding bits).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Finally, for each ATM cell being generated, be it from pure ATM, via routing (115) or deriving from segmentation in (118), a cell CRC8 is generated (not shown in FIG. 10) and reinserted as required.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The above is a simplified version of the Receive Adapter which might also include several improvements like, for instance, a backpressure mechanism to enable further regulating the traffic.  In conclusion, those skilled in the art of digital\n",
      "communication network will appreciate the advantages of the proposed method for optimizing link bandwidth utilization by PTM traffic, e.g. voice traffic.  The invention is fairly simple to implement and is transparent to existing networks.  No\n",
      "modification of hardware or software of existing networks are required since a fairly simple Line Interface Adapter can be installed in existing network node adapters.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The gain in bandwidth obtained when using this invention, may be on the order of 20%.  Assume, as previously mentioned, an existing conventional network with E1 connections multiplexing 31 voice circuits each being assigned 0.5 ms blocks (i.e. 4\n",
      "bytes).  Then a conventional PTM packet will have 4*31=124 bytes, plus 6 bytes for header and trailer, which makes 130 byte long packets.  The AAL5 segmentation operations breaks these into 3 cells.  With cell overhead needed to get ATM-like cells, each\n",
      "E1 connection requires (3*(48+5)*8)/0.5=2544 Kbps.  Also assuming an OC3/STM1 link, with a 149768 Kbps bandwidth, and assuming the network operating between 85% and 96% bandwidth reservation, then the number of E1 connections per OC3/STM1 would be\n",

      "<br/><br/>When using the invention, the voice packet will be 3+4*31=127 bytes long (assuming the header includes, in addition to the payload, HEC, CNT and (F+LAB), each one byte long).  The required bandwidth is now (8*127)/0.5=2032 Kbps.  The number of E1\n",
      "per OC3/STM1, with same bandwidth reservation assumptions as above, becomes between (0.85*149768)/2032=62%, and (0.96*149768)/2032=70%.  In other words, the invention leads to an improvement in link bandwidth utilization between 24% and 28%, which given\n",

      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND ART\n",
      "<br/><br/>High Speed Packet Switching Networks\n",
      "<br/><br/>Data transmission is now evolving with a specific focus on applications and by integrating a fundamental shift in the customer traffic profile.  Driven by the growth of workstations, the local area networks interconnection, the distributed\n",
      "processing between workstations and super computers, the new applications and the integration of various and often conflicting structures--hierarchical versus peer to peer, wide versus local area networks, voice versus data--the data profile has become\n",
      "more bandwidth consuming, bursting, non-deterministic and requires more connectivity.  Based on the above, there is strong requirement for supporting distributed computing applications across high speed networks that can carry local area network\n",
      "communications, voice, video and traffic among channel attached hosts, business, engineering workstations, terminals, and small to intermediate file servers.  This vision of a high speed multi-protocol network is the driver for the emergence of fast\n",
      "packet switching networks architectures in which data, voice, and video information is digitally encoded, chopped into small packets and transmitted through a common set of nodes and links.\n",
      "<br/><br/>An efficient transport of mixed traffic streams on very high speed lines means for these new network architecture a set of requirements in term of performance and resource consumption which can be summarized as follows\n",
      "<br/><br/>a very high throughput and a very short packet processing time, a very large flexibility to support a wide range of connectivity options, an efficient flow and congestion control.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Throughput and Processing Time\n",
      "<br/><br/>One of the key requirement of high speed packet switching networks is to reduce the end to end delay in order to satisfy real time delivery constraints and to achieve the necessary high nodal throughput for the transport of voice and video. \n",
      "Increases in link speeds have not been matched by proportionate increases in the processing speeds of communication nodes and the fundamental challenge for high speed networks is to minimize the processing time and to take full advantage of the high\n",
      "speed/low error rate technologies, most of the transport and control functions provided by the new high bandwidth network architectures are performed on an end to end basis.  The flow control and particularly the path selection and bandwidth management\n",
      "processes are managed by the access points of the network which reduces both the awareness and the function of the intermediate nodes.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Connectivity\n",
      "<br/><br/>In high speed networks, the nodes must provide a total connectivity.  This includes attachment of the user's devices, regardless of vendor or protocol, and the ability to have the end user communicated with any other device.  The network must\n",
      "support any type of traffic including data, voice, video, fax, graphic or image.  Nodes must be able to take advantage of all common carrier facilities and to be adaptable to a plurality of protocols.  All needed conversions must be automatic and\n",
      "transparent to the end user.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Congestion and Flow Control\n",
      "<br/><br/>Communication networks have at their disposal limited resources to ensure an efficient packets transmission.  An efficient bandwidth management is essential to take full advantage of a high speed network.  While transmission costs per byte\n",
      "continue to drop year after year, transmission costs are likely to continue to represent the major expense of operating future telecommunication networks as the demand for bandwidth increases.  Thus considerable efforts have been spent on designing flow\n",
      "and congestion control processes, bandwidth reservation mechanisms, routing algorithms to manage the network bandwidth.  An ideal network should be able to transmit an useful traffic directly proportional to the traffic offered to the network and this as\n",
      "far as the maximum transmission capacity is reached.  Beyond this limit, the network should operate at its maximum capacity whatever the demand is.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Routing Modes\n",
      "<br/><br/>A general problem in the communication networks is to find a path between a source and a destination node.  When the network is using datagrams, the path selection must be done individually for each packet.  For virtual circuits, the path\n",
      "decision is done once only at the time of the connection (or session) establishment.  In both cases, the choice of a routing algorithm is not easy because it must satisfy a large number of often conflicting requirements.  However, the routing algorithm\n",
      "must allow to exploit the network in an optimal way, according to a criterion which can vary with the utilization type.  In most of the cases, the network is realized in a way to minimize the packet transit time and to transfer the maximum number of\n",
      "packets.  In other cases, the objective is to decrease the communication cost, or to develop a reliable network able to operate correctly either in case of catastrophic line, node failure or peaks of traffic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Because of the variety of the constraints, there are a large number of different routing types like flooding routing, random or stochastic routing, deterministic routing.  This last routing technique can be implemented according to particular\n",
      "modes such as fixed or adaptive routing, centralized or distributed routing, node by node or end to end routing, connection oriented or connectionless routing .  . .\n",
      "<br/><br/>Adaptive Routing\n",
      "<br/><br/>Contrary to the Fixed Routing, where the routing rules are established once for all, the purpose of the Adaptive Routing is to satisfy at any time the optimization criteria.  Tables are permanently updated according for example, the instantaneous\n",
      "state of the traffic on the links.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Distributed Routing\n",
      "<br/><br/>When the characteristics of the network fluctuate, it is possible to adapt the routing by assigning to one node the responsibility to update periodically the routing tables according to the traffic and the topology.  The principal disadvantage of\n",
      "this method called Centralized Routing is to generate an important auxiliary traffic and to subordinate the good functioning of the network to only one node.  On the other hand, the Centralized Routing can generate some problems at the time the tables\n",
      "are refreshed because said tables cannot be received at the same time by all the nodes.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The solution is to decentralize the tables at the level of each node.  The Distributed Routing is a method in which neighboring nodes are exchanging messages concerning the traffic and the network conditions to update their own routing table.\n",
      "<br/><br/>End-to-End Routing\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Adaptive and Distributive Routing are both currently used together in most high speed networks.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In order to minimize the processing time and to take full advantage of the high speed/low error rate technologies, the transport and control functions provided by the high bandwidth networks are performed on an end to end basis.  No hop by hop\n",
      "error recovery or retransmission is envisioned in high speed, high performance (low error) links and thus, there is no need for transit nodes to be aware of individual transport connections.  The originating node is responsible for calculating the route\n",
      "that a packet must take through the network.  The routing of the packets presents two aspects for which a wide range of implementing methods exists\n",
      "<br/><br/>1.  Determining what the route for a given connection shall be,\n",
      "<br/><br/>2.  Actually switching the packet within a switching node.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Connection-Oriented Routing\n",
      "<br/><br/>One distinguishing characteristic of a network is the presence or absence of a \"connections\" between end users.  They are many ways of constructing connectionless or connection-oriented networks.  In most of cases, packets using different routing\n",
      "modes can share the same data transmission facilities.  Most of the high speed connections are established on a reserved path to guarantee the bandwidth and the quality of service requested by the user.  The path across the network is computed in\n",
      "response to each connection request by the originating node.  The computed path is based on the parameters characterizing the network connection's requirements and on link capacity and load information maintained within each network node.  The\n",
      "originating node sends a reservation request to the end node.  As the bandwidth request packet flows along the chosen path, each transit node determines whether it has enough capacity to accept the new connection.  If the connection is accepted, the\n",
      "requested bandwidth is reserved.  Changes are reflected in every node of the network by means of control messages.  Once a connection is established, there is no need to place a destination address in the packet header every time a packet is sent.  All\n",
      "that is needed is an identifier to specify which connection is to be used for this packet.  Due to the low packet overhead, the connection oriented routing technique is particularly adapted to the transmission of very short packets (for example real-time\n",
      "voice connections).  This technique requires that connection tables be set up and maintained dynamically in each node and this restricting makes datagram transport quite inefficient.  The implementation of flow and congestion control in a connection\n",
      "oriented network is easier than in a connectionless one because network nodes can regulate the flow on individual connections.  However, when a link or a node becomes inoperative (goes down) connections that were passing through the affected link or node\n",
      "are typically lost.  A new connection must be established through a different route.  This takes time and may disrupt the connection at the end user level.  In comparison, connectionless networks typically reroute traffic automatically around link or\n",
      "node failures.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Path Selection\n",
      "<br/><br/>The role of the Path Selection process is to determine optimum paths for users across the network each time a connection is requested.  This implies the allocation of network resources to users in order to guarantee their quality-of-service\n",
      "requirements while optimizing the overall throughput within the network.  This function takes place entirely within the origin node.  Various quality of service parameters may be specified by the users, some of them in order to satisfy realtime delivery\n",
      "constraints, others related to non real time data traffic transfer .  . . The origin node computes a path to the destination node that is capable of carrying the new connection and providing the level of service required by the new connection.  The Path\n",
      "Selection algorithm uses data describing the current traffic load in the entire network (nodes and links).  Such data are stored in a topology database located in each node of the network.  If no suitable path can be found to meet all requirements, the\n",
      "connection is rejected.  Once, the origin node has found a suitable path, a set up message is generated which traverses the selected route, updating the resource allocations for each link visited by the set up message.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To meet high throughput, paths are selected and resources reserved once only at the time of the connection establishment.  The Path Selection algorithm takes into account various constraints which comes both from the user (quality of service\n",
      "requirements, user's traffic characteristics) and from the current network topology and bandwidth allocation.  In addition, the algorithm maximizes the network throughput by choosing a path with the least number of hops and which tends to achieve an even\n",
      "distribution of the traffic among the links.  Once an appropriate path has been selected, the network connection establishment process takes place, and only then are the resources along the path reserved.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Connection Set Up Delay\n",
      "<br/><br/>Selecting a path and setting up a connection can take considerable processing overhead in network nodes and can generate a significant delay.  For end nodes supporting multiple connections set up requests simultaneously, it is easy to have some\n",
      "sort of scheduling to avoid bottlenecks in the connection set up process.  But nethertheless, the time for establishing a connection may be huge.  For permanent connections the set up delay probably does not have very much meaning.  However, for\n",
      "connections service in real-time, this is a very important parameter, especially since some connections terminate in equipment that runs time-outs.\n",
      "<br/><br/>This delay is also important from the point of view of path switching on failure or preemption.  The rerouting of a lot of connections that were using a failing link or node may lead to a high number of simultaneous new path set up.  The\n",
      "establishment in parallel of multiple new connections through alternate routes take time and usually disrupt the connections at the end user level.  The non-disruptive path switch mechanism suppose that:\n",
      "<br/><br/>first, the physical network has enough residual capacity to accommodate the network connections affected by the failure event, and\n",
      "<br/><br/>second, the path selection delay is minimized in order to preserve the connections at the end user level.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Large network are highly dynamic and ideally, the Path Selection algorithm should be executed each time a new connection is established to take into account the most recent image of the network.  Practically, such a computation would demand an\n",
      "inordinate amount of processing time and is rarely justified during the life of a connection.  It would be a waste of resource and money to use a very efficient processor for supporting a burst of path selections at set up time or when a failure occurs\n",
      "and then to keep it idle for hours.  On the other hand, it is not useful to select a path based on a perfect image of the network when the status of links and nodes evolves continually.  More the demand for bandwidth reservation is available, more the\n",
      "precision required for finding a path can be low.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In large high speed packet switching networks, the support of a high number of connection set up operations implies some requirements in term of performance and resource consumption which can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "<br/><br/>The origin node--or the node providing the route calculation for the origin node--must be able to decide where to route an incoming packet with a guaranteed quality of service (delay, loss, probability .  . . ) in a very short portion of time. \n",
      "The computation must be sufficiently rapid to select an optimum path for each connection request.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In case of node or link failure, the origin node must be able to establish alternative connections without disrupting the traffic at the end user level.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The processing time in nodes must be minimized.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The network resources in the origin node, along the selected path and within the entire network must be optimized.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To optimize the node resources (processing capacity) while minimizing the connection set up delay, routes from the origin node to any destination node in the network can be pre-calculated independently of any connection request.  This\n",
      "pre-calculation is executed in background when the connection set up process is idle.  When a connection is requested, the path selection process first searches for a pre-calculated route.  That is only when no pre-calculated path can be found, that the\n",
      "path selection algorithm is triggered.  The path is computed and used for establishing the connection and routing the packets within the network.  Said path is also stored in a list of pre-selected paths.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In order to optimize the network resources in term of overall throughput, the Path Selection process takes into account the current traffic conditions on the links.  Consequently, the pre-calculated paths must be continuously updated according to\n",
      "the load variation on the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In case of link failure, it is important to reroute the traffic on alternative paths without any disruption of the end user connections.  In general, the closer to the destination node the link is, the more the link carries connections towards\n",
      "this destination node.  A failure on a link adjacent to an origin or destination node may entail a disruption of a lot of connections and may invalidate several pre selected routes.  A solution is to pre-calculate more than one route for every\n",
      "destination node, each route using different links adjacent to the origin and destination nodes.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Therefore, a method must be provided for determining as fast as possible a route which fulfills the connection requirements in term of quality of service while optimizing the network resources.\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>The present invention is directed to packet switching communication networks comprising a plurality of nodes interconnected with transmission links.  The object of the present invention is to minimize in access nodes the connection set up delay,\n",

      "servers (215), PBX (Private Branch exchange 216) or video servers (217).  These user networks, dispersed in different establishments, need to be interconnected through wide area transport facilities and different approaches can be used for organizing the\n",

      "network by the users is realized through Access Nodes (202 to 205) located at the periphery.  These Access Nodes comprise one or more Ports, each one providing an access point for attaching external devices supporting standard interfaces to the network\n",
      "and performing the conversions required to transport the users data flow across the network from and to other external devices.  As example, the Access Node (202) interfaces respectively a Private Branch exchange (PBX), an application server and a hub\n",
      "through three Ports and communicates through the network by means of the adjacent Transit Nodes (201), (205) and (208).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Switching Nodes\n",
      "<br/><br/>Each network node (201 to 208) includes a Routing Point where the incoming data packets are selectively routed on the outgoing Trunks towards the neighboring Transit Nodes.  Such routing decisions are made according to the information contained\n",
      "in the header of the data packets.  In addition to the basic packet routing function, the network nodes provide ancillary services such as:\n",
      "<br/><br/>the determination of routing paths for packets originated in the node,\n",
      "<br/><br/>directory services like retrieving and updating information about network users and resources,\n",
      "<br/><br/>the maintaining of a consistent view of the physical network topology, including link utilization information, and\n",
      "<br/><br/>the reservation of resources at access points of the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>According to the present invention, these ancillary services include:\n",
      "<br/><br/>the storage of routing paths within the node\n",
      "<br/><br/>the updating of these paths.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Each Port is connected to a plurality of user processing equipments, each user equipment comprising either a source of digital data to be transmitted to another user system, or a data sink for consuming digital data received from another user\n",
      "system, or, typically, both.  The interpretation of the users protocols, the translation of the users data into packets formatted appropriately for their transmission on the packet network (200) and the generation of a header to route these packets are\n",
      "executed by an Access Agent running in the Port.  This header is made of Control, Routing and Redundancy Check Fields.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Routing Fields contain all the information necessary to route the packet through the network (200) to the destination node to which it is addressed.\n",
      "<br/><br/>These fields can take several formats depending on the routing mode specified (connection oriented or connectionless routing mode .  . . ).\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Control Fields include, among other things, an encoded identification of the protocol to be used in terpreting the Routing Fields.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Redundancy Check Fields are used to check for errors in the header itself.  If an error is detected, the packet is discarded.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Routing Points\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 3 shows a general block diagram of a typical Routing Point (300) such as can be found in the network nodes (201 to 208) illustrated in FIG. 2.  A Routing Point comprises a high speed packet Switch (302) onto which packets arriving at the\n",
      "Routing Point are entered.  Such packets are received:\n",
      "<br/><br/>from other nodes over high speed transmission links (303) via Trunk Adapters (304).\n",
      "<br/><br/>from users via application adapters called Ports (301).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Using information in the packet header, the adapters (304, 301) determine which packets are to be routed by means of the Switch (302) towards a local user network (307) or towards a transmission link (303) leaving the node.  The adapters (301 and\n",
      "304) include queuing circuits for queuing packets prior to or subsequent to their launch on the Switch (302).\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Route Controller (305) calculates the optimum paths through the network (200) so as to satisfy a given set of quality of services specified by the user and to minimize the amount of network resources used to complete the communication path. \n",
      "Then, it builds the header of the packets generated in the Routing Point.  The optimization criterion includes the number of intermediates nodes, the characteristics of the connection request, the capabilities and the utilisation of the links (Trunks) in\n",
      "the path, the number of intermediate nodes .  . . According to the present invention, the optimum route is stored in a Routing Database (308) for further reuse.\n",
      "<br/><br/>All the information necessary for the routing, about the nodes and transmission links connected to the nodes, are contained in a Network Topology Database (306).  Under steady state condition, every Routing Point has the same view of the network. The network topology information is updated when new links are activated, new nodes added to the network, when links or nodes are dropped or when link loads change significantly.  Such information is exchanged by means of control messages with all other\n",
      "Route Controllers to provide the up-to-date topological information neeeded for path selection (such database updates are carried on packets very similar to the data packets exchanged between end users of the network).  The fact that the network topology\n",
      "is kept current in every node through continuous updates allows dynamic network reconfigurations without disrupting end users logical connections (sessions).\n",
      "<br/><br/>The incoming transmission links to the packet Routing Point may comprise links from external devices in the local user networks (210) or links (Trunks) from adjacent network nodes (209).  In any case, the Routing Point operates in the same manner\n",
      "to receive each data packet and forward it on to another Routing Point is dictated by the information in the packet header.  The fast packet switching network operates to enable a communication between any two end user applications without dedicating any\n",
      "transmission or node facilities to that communication path except for the duration of a single packet.  In this way, the utilisation of the communication facilities of the packet network is optimized to carry significantly more traffic than would be\n",
      "possible with dedicated transmission links for each communication path.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Network Management\n",
      "<br/><br/>Network Control Functions\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Network Control Functions are those that control, allocate, and manage the resources of the physical network.  Each Routing Point has a set of the foregoing functions in the Route Controller (305) and uses it to facilitate the establishment\n",
      "and the maintenance of the connections between users applications.  The Network Control Functions include in particular:\n",
      "<br/><br/>Directory Services\n",
      "<br/><br/>for retrieving and maintaining information about network users and resources.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Bandwidth Management\n",
      "<br/><br/>for processing the bandwidth reservation and maintenance messages, and\n",
      "<br/><br/>for monitoring the current reservation levels on links.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Path Selection\n",
      "<br/><br/>for choosing the best path for each new connection considering the connection requirements and the current link utilisation levels.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Control Spanning Tree\n",
      "<br/><br/>for establishing and maintaining a routing tree among the network nodes,\n",
      "<br/><br/>for using it to distribute control information (in parallel) including link utilisation, and\n",
      "<br/><br/>for updating the Topology Database of the nodes with new network configurations or link/node failures.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Topology Update\n",
      "<br/><br/>for distributing and maintaining, using the Spanning Tree, information about the logical and physical network (including link utilization information) in every node.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Congestion Control\n",
      "<br/><br/>for enforcing the bandwidth reservation agreements between the network's users and the network which are established at the call set up time, and\n",
      "<br/><br/>for estimating actual bandwidth and for adjusting reservation if necessary during the life of the connection.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Topology Database (TDB)\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Topology Database contains information about nodes, links, their properties, and the bandwidth allocation.  The topology information is replicated in each node of the network.  An algorithm guarantees the correctness of each node's Topology\n",
      "Database when links and nodes are added or deleted or when their characteristics change.  The database comprises:\n",
      "<br/><br/>the physical topology of the network which includes static information like physical characteristics of nodes and links,\n",
      "<br/><br/>the state of nodes and links, and\n",
      "<br/><br/>the link utilisation which includes dynamic characteristics like current bandwidth (used and reserved), real time measurements .  . .\n",
      "<br/><br/>The general organisation of the Topology Database is shown in FIG. 5.  To each resource in the network, nodes (501) or links (502), is associated an entry in the database.  In particular, each link entry includes the following characteristics:\n",
      "<br/><br/>(503) the link physical properties:\n",
      "<br/><br/>transmission medium and speed,\n",
      "<br/><br/>routing mode supported,\n",

      "<br/><br/>(505) the link utilization:\n",
      "<br/><br/>real time measurements,\n",
      "<br/><br/>reserved bandwidth, .  . .\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 6 shows in a table, some of the information stored in the Topology Database.  Though all characteristics of the links are listed in each node, in the present application only a few will be described:\n",
      "<br/><br/>Total Capacity (bps) C.sub.ij\n",
      "<br/><br/>The topology Database contains, for each link, its Total Capacity.  The value C.sub.ij represents the total bandwidth available on the link between nodes i and j.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Reservable Fraction (%) rf\n",
      "<br/><br/>As might be expected, one of the critical characteristics of transmission links is the fraction of the link capacity effectively available.  Links cannot be loaded up to a theoretical maximum load (bandwidth) for two reasons:\n",
      "<br/><br/>first, to set aside bandwidth for network control functions, and\n",
      "<br/><br/>secondly, to keep the loss probabilities and queuing delays low in the case of short term bandwidth violations by the different traffic sources.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The reservable fraction of a link rf is the effective percentage of the Total Capacity C.sub.ij that can be reserved on the link between nodes i and j to maintain a reasonable quality of transmission.  If C.sub.ij is the Total Capacity of the\n",
      "link, then R.sub.ij =rf.times.C.sub.ij is the Reservable Capacity of this link ({character pullout}.sub.ij.ltoreq.R.sub.ij.ltoreq.C.sub.ij).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Note: For most network architectures, no more than 85% of the total bandwidth of a link C.sub.ij can be explicitly reserved for user traffic (rf&lt;0.85).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Total Reserved Equivalent Capacity (bps) {character pullout}.sub.R,ij\n",
      "<br/><br/>For a connection k on a link between nodes i and j, the simplest way to provide low/no packet loss would be to reserve the entire bandwidth requested by the user.  However, for bursty user traffic, this approach can waste a significant amount of\n",
      "bandwidth accross the network.  To save resources, the bandwidth amount actually reserved is equal to an \"Equivalent Capacity\" {character pullout}.sub.K,ij said Equivalent Capacity being a function of the source characteristics and of the network status. The bandwidth reservation falls somewhere between the average bandwidth required by the user and the maximum capacity of the connection.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The value ##EQU1##\n",
      "<br/><br/>=sum of the reserved Equivalent Capacities represents the total bandwidth reserved on the link between nodes i and j by K connections already established.  If the difference between this already link Equivalent Capacity {character\n",
      "pullout}.sub.R,ij and the Total Reservable Capacity of the rf.times.C.sub.ij is less than the bandwidth requested by a new reserved connection then the link cannot be selected.\n",
      "<br/><br/>However, the link may be selected for a non-reserved connection where no explicit bandwidth reservation is needed.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Note: the Equivalent Capacity is calculated from values called \"link metrics\" representing the aggregation of all connections (possibly with varied characteristics) traversing a link.  Link metrics are distributed to other nodes via a topology\n",
      "update broadcast.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Total Bandwidth used by NAon-Reserved Traffic (bps) M.sub.NR,ij The value M.sub.NR,ij represents the total load or bandwidth currently used by non-reserved traffic as measured on the link between nodes i and j.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Maximum Packet Size (bytes) mps.sub.ij mps.sub.ij is defined as the maximum packet size supported by the link between nodes i and j.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Total Bandwidth Used (bps) {character pullout}.sub.T,ij The Total Bandwidth Used {character pullout}.sub.T,ij on the link between node i and node j is computed by adding the total reserved bandwidth {character pullout}.sub.T,ij and the measured\n",
      "bandwidth M.sub.NR,ij used by non-reserved traffic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Bandwidth Management\n",
      "<br/><br/>Users are requiring different quality-of-services.  In order to provide the various service levels, different types of network connections are established.  A connection is defined as a path in the network between the origin access node and the\n",
      "destination access node representing respectively the source user and the target user.  Networks connections can be classified as reserved or non-reserved.  Reserved network connections require bandwidth to be allocated in advance along the chosen path.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Most of the high speed connections are established on a reserved path to guarantee the quality of service and the bandwidth requested by the user.  This path across the network is computed by the origin node using information in its Topology\n",
      "Database including current link utilizations.  The origin node then sends a reservation request along the chosen path, and intermediate nodes (if allowing the reservation) then add this additionally reserved capacity to their total.  These changes are\n",
      "reflected in topology broadcast updates sent by the intermediate nodes.  Intermediate nodes need not to have an awareness of the status of each connection on their adjacent links.  If an intermediate node does get too many packets, generally because of\n",
      "unanticipated burstiness, it simply discards them (the user can select a service that will recover from such discards).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Depending on the node type, the function of the Bandwidth Management is:\n",
      "<br/><br/>in the origin node,\n",
      "<br/><br/>to identify the best possible route according to the network status and the connection parameters including the connection priority,\n",
      "<br/><br/>to reserve at connection setup, the bandwidth required by the network connections and to maintain this bandwidth for the duration of the connection.\n",
      "<br/><br/>to reject the connection if resources needed to satisfy the request are not available in the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>in a transit node,\n",
      "<br/><br/>to administer the bandwidth reservations on the links.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Connection Set Up\n",
      "<br/><br/>The connection set up and bandwidth reservation process, as shown in FIG. 1, comprises the following steps:\n",
      "<br/><br/>(101) a Connection Request is specified by the user via a set of parameters including origin and destination network address, and data flow characteristics (bit rate, burstiness).\n",
      "<br/><br/>(102) a Path Selection process determines a path and a set of connection requests, one for each link of the path, using parameters provided by the Topology Database.\n",
      "<br/><br/>(103) a Bandwidth Reservation process uses the connection requests to reserve bandwidth on each of the links of the path.  This process involves exchange of information (109) between the origin (access) node (100), the transit nodes (107) on the\n",
      "path, and the destination node (108).\n",
      "<br/><br/>(104) Bandwidth Reservation replies from transit nodes and end node generate either a call acceptance or a call reject (110).\n",
      "<br/><br/>(105) a Link metric Update process updates, in case of call acceptance, the modified link metrics.  This information (111) is sent through the Control Spanning Tree to the Topology Database of each node in the network by means of a broadcast\n",
      "algorithm.\n",
      "<br/><br/>(106) a Congestion Control Set Up adjusts, if the call is accepted, the network connection characteristics.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Path Selection\n",
      "<br/><br/>The purpose of the Path Selection process is to determine the best way to allocate network resources to connections both to guarantee that user quality of service requirements are satisfied and also to optimize the overall throughput of the\n",
      "network.  The Path Selection process must supply to the requesting user a path over the network over which a point-to-point connection will be established, and some bandwidth will be reserved if needed.  The Path Selection algorithm uses as input\n",
      "parameters on one hand the user requirements and on the other hand the status of the network links and nodes as maintained in the Topology Database.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Selection Criteria:\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Path Selection process takes place entirely within the node wherein the connection is requested.  It makes use of the Topology Database and selects the \"best path\" based on each of the following criteria in order of importance:\n",
      "<br/><br/>Quality-of-Service\n",
      "<br/><br/>The connection's quality-of-service requirements are to be satisfied throughout the life of the connection.  There are a large number of variables that determine the performance of a network.  However, the quality-of-service can be defined as the\n",
      "set of measurable quantities that describe the user's perception of the service offered by the network.  Some of the quality-of service parameters are listed below:\n",
      "<br/><br/>connection set up delay,\n",
      "<br/><br/>connection blocking probability,\n",
      "<br/><br/>loss probability,\n",
      "<br/><br/>error probability,\n",
      "<br/><br/>end-to-end transit delay,\n",
      "<br/><br/>end-to-end delay variation,\n",
      "<br/><br/>. . .\n",
      "<br/><br/>Some of these quantities have an effect upon how paths are computed, for example the packet loss probability or the end-to-end transit delay: the sum of propagation delays along a computed path may not violate the end-to-end transit delay\n",
      "specifications.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Minimum Hop:\n",
      "<br/><br/>The path shall consist of as few links as feasible to support the connection's quality of service requirements, thus minimizing the amount of network resources as well as processing costs to support the connection.  The path computation is based\n",
      "on the links utilization at the time the connection is requested.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Load Balancing\n",
      "<br/><br/>Among a minimum hop path, a path with \"lightly loaded\" links is preferred over a path with \"more heavily loaded\" links based on the network conditions at the time of path selection.  The load of a link depend of the customer criteria: it can be\n",
      "an increasing function of the total reserved bandwidth of the link, proportional to the amount of traffic actually measured on the link, .  . . When the path load (sum of the load of the links over the selected path) is the preponderant criterion of\n",
      "selection, the path of lesser load is chosen.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Satisfying the first requirement is the key factor in path selection and the other two functions are used to optimize traffic through the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Path Calculation: The Path Selection process collects all the input information and calculates first the Equivalent Capacity of the new network connection.  Then potential paths through the network from the origin to the destination node(s) are\n",
      "calculated.  The Topology Database is used to determine the suitability of links for the potential path.  The algorithm constructs new potential paths, adding links and nodes on a hop-by-hop basis, checking at each stage that the user requirements are\n",
      "being met.\n",
      "<br/><br/>At each stage, as links are added into a potential path, the algorithm determines that the new link has enough bandwidth to meet the resource reservation requirements.  The algorithm also checks, at each stage, that addition of the new link still\n",
      "allow the total path to meet the user quality-of-service requirements.  The algorithm is different for the different traffic classes.  For example the end-to-end delay variation (jitter) requirements is more important for the real-time graphic\n",
      "calculation than for non-real time.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Additional Requirements: If the Path Selection process finds a number of suitable potential paths for a new network connection, which all meet the quality of service requirements, then it will select the path with the minimum number of hops as\n",
      "the optimal paths.  This is because the minimum-hop path will result in the least amount of reserved bandwidth in the network, and therefore preserve network resources and reduce cost.\n",
      "<br/><br/>If the Path Selection process detects a number of suitable minimum-hop paths for a new network connection, which all meet the quality-of-service requirements, then it will select a path with more \"lightly loaded\" links in preference with heavily\n",
      "loaded links.  The link utilizations from the Topology Database are used in this calculation.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Routing Database Structure\n",
      "<br/><br/>The general organization of the Routing Database (400) is shown in FIG. 4.  The Routing Database is divided in two tables:\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Path Table (410) for recording the routing paths, and\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Link Table (420) for recording the links related to said routing paths stored in said path Table (410).\n",
      "<br/><br/>In a preferred embodiment, Path and Link Tables are implemented as hash tables with direct chaining in an overflow area as described in publication entitled \"Algorithms+Data Structures =Programs\" for Niklaus Wirth (pages 264 to 274, Prentice-Hall\n",
      "Inc).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Path Table\n",
      "<br/><br/>For the present application, only some of the parameters stored in the Path Table (410) will be described.  Each entry of the Path Table represents a path between an origin node and a destination node in the network satisfying specific quality of\n",
      "service and traffic requirements:\n",
      "<br/><br/>Destination Node (412) Identification of the last node on the path.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Path Characteristics (413)\n",
      "<br/><br/>Maximum Packet Size: minimum of the maximum packet sizes supported by all links on the path calculated for all of the different delay priorities (real-time, non-real-time, non reserved delay priorities).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Maximum delay : sum of the transfer delay of all link on the path calculated for each of the different delay priorities (circuit emulation real-time, non-realtime, delay priorities).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Maximum delay variation (Jitter): sum of maximum delay variation of all links on the path calculated for all of the different delay priorities (real-time, non-real-time, delay priorities).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Loss probability: sum of loss probabilities of all links in the path calculated for all of the different delay priorities (real-time, non-real-time, best effort delay priorities).  The loss probability may be estimated by the ratio (lost\n",
      "information)/(total information transferred).  The lost information is information sent by the origin node that never arrives at the intended destination due to network conditions (congestion, traffic policing, errors .  . . ).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Minimization criteria: depending on its type, a connection may pose its quality-of-service requirements and in particular its delay requirements in term of:\n",
      "<br/><br/>End-to-end delay without limit: among all possible paths, the path with the minimum end-to-end delay is selected.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Maximum absolute end-to-end delay: the path chosen guarantees that the end-to-end delay will be below the specified value throughout the life of the connection.  This type of link delay constant is used mostly for real time traffic, which has a\n",
      "stringent end-to-end delay requirement.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Maximum end-to-end delay variation (maximum jitter): the amount by which the delay associated with a service varies is also known as \"delay jitter\".  For some types of services a considerable delay may be acceptable provided that it is\n",
      "predictable, that is, the delay jitter is kept small.  For other services (for example, voice services) both the delay and the delay jitter need to be kept small.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Maximum end-to-end delay with playout buffer; for application involving isochronous traffic (for example, voice), a playout buffer is required at the destination node to smooth out the effects of delay variation and to ensure that packets are\n",
      "sent to the user at regular intervals.  The amount of playout delay is selected to equal the maximum end-to-end delay variation that should be cancelled (jitter).  The playout delay contributes to the end-to-end delay.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Security level (encryption) support: many organizations are concerned that their internal communications may be intercepted by eavesdroppers.  To minimize the likelihood that communications can be intercepted, there are number of measures that\n",
      "can be taken: for example, using communication links that are harder to intercept such as optical fibers, or using encryption devices.  However such security measures may not be required for all services as their use may involved additional expense or\n",
      "inconvenience.  Therefore, there is a requirement when establishing a service to specify the security requirements for the service.  The specification of the security needs for a service are generally specified using a security level.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Hop count: number of links in the path.  The path selection process calculates a path with as few links as possible that supports the quality-of-service requirements of each requested connection.  However, it may be desirable to put an upper\n",
      "limit on the number of hops in the chosen path.  What this means is that there is a certain maximum number of hop which the cost of using the path becomes unacceptably high.  In a preferred embodiment, the path selection algorithms check the candidate\n",
      "paths in the increasing number of hops and stop when the imposed maximum number of hop is reached.  If more than one minimum-hop path satisfying the quality-of-service requirements is found, the one with the \"lightly loaded\" links is preferred over a\n",
      "path with \"more heavily loaded\" links based on the network conditions at the time of path selection.  In most of cases, this condition tends to maximize the overall throughput of the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Bandwidth reservation support: network connections are primarily classified, based on their network resource needs, into either:\n",
      "<br/><br/>Reserved network connections.  Reserved network connections require the reservation of some network resources prior to successful establishment of the network connection.  If the network resources required for a network connection cannot be\n",
      "allocated, establishment of the network connection will fail.  Of particular interest are reserved network connections that reserve bandwidth as these types of network connections are capable of providing a quality-of-service.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Non-reserved network connections.  The non-bandwidth-reserved traffic is delayable, has a low average bandwidth, may last a very short time and its burstiness characteristics may not be known.  The lowest delay is assigned to non-reserved traffic\n",
      "and the network drops non-reserved packets when their buffer overflow at intermediate nodes.  That is why the transfer delay and loss probability are not part of the quality-of-service guaranteed to non-reserved connections.\n",
      "<br/><br/>While the connectionless routing mode is quite efficient to route packets that does not require any reservation nor quality-of-service, connection oriented routing mode is well adapted to route packets when reservation and quality-of-service are\n",
      "expected and provided.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Real-time traffic support: Each type of network traffic has its own particular characteristics and therefore needs to be treated differently.  The traffic types may be summarized as follows:\n",
      "<br/><br/>traffic that is delay-and loss-sensitive, for example interactive video.\n",
      "<br/><br/>traffic that is delay-sensitive but tolerant to moderate losses, for example voice.\n",

      "<br/><br/>This invention relates to congestion detection and flow control in high speed packet switching networks and more particularly to methods and apparatus for implementing congestion detection and flow control for low priority traffic with optimized\n",
      "cost efficiency.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND ART\n",
      "<br/><br/>Modern digital networks often operate in a multimedia environment and interconnect, upon demand, very large numbers of users and applications through fairly complex digital communication network topologies.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Due to the variety of users' demands and the growth of distributed applications, network traffic is consuming more bandwidth, becoming more non-deterministic and requiring more connectivity.  These changes have been the driver for the emergence\n",
      "of fast packet switching network architectures in which data, voice and video information are digitally encoded, chopped into fixed or variable length packets (also named \"cells in ATM or Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks) and transmitted through a\n",
      "common set of nodes and links interconnected to constitute the network communication facilities.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The need for efficient transport of mixed traffic streams on very high speed lines (sometimes referred to as links or trunks), means, imposes a set of performance and resource consumption requirements including very high throughput, very short\n",
      "packet processing time, the flexibility to support a wide range of connectivity options and efficient flow and congestion control.  Congestion is generally defined as a condition during which network performance is degraded due to saturation of network\n",
      "resources such as communication links, processor cycles, memory buffers, etc.\n",
      "<br/><br/>One of the key requirements for high speed packet switching networks is reduction of end to end delay in order to satisfy real time delivery constraints and to achieve the necessary high nodal throughput for the transport of voice and video. \n",
      "Increases in link speeds have not been matched by proportionate increases in the processing speeds of communication nodes.  The fundamental challenge for high speed networks is to minimize the processing time and to take full advantage of the high\n",
      "speed/low error rate technologies.  Most of the transport and control functions provided by the new high bandwidth network architectures are performed on an end to end basis.\n",
      "<br/><br/>One basic advantage of packet switching techniques (as opposed to so-called circuit switching techniques) is that it allows statistical multiplexing of the different types of data over a line, which optimizes the utilization of transmission\n",
      "bandwidth.  One drawback, however, is that packet switching introduces delays and jitters which might be detrimental for transmission of isochronous data, like video or voice.  Methods have been proposed to control the network in such a way that delays\n",
      "and jitters are bounded for every new connection that is set up across the packet switched network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Such methods are described, for instance, in a published European Application number 0000706297 and include establishing a path through the network high speed lines and nodes, via an entry node port of said network, making optimal use of the\n",
      "available transmission bandwidth of the network along the path to the indicated destination.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Because different type of traffics need to be treated differently to maintain their usefulness at a destination, choices have to be made among the different types by assigning different specific priorities.  In other words, when a source terminal\n",
      "requests a connection to a destination terminal via the network (i.e., a call is set-up), a quality of service (QoS) is assigned to the call in terms of maximum permissible delay (T.sub.13 max) and packet loss probability (P_loss).\n",
      "<br/><br/>The QoS and traffic characteristics (e.g., peak data rate, mean data rate and average packet length) are used to compute the amount of bandwidth (i.e. equivalent capacity or Ceq) to be reserved on every line on the route or path assigned to the\n",
      "traffic between the source terminal and the destination terminal, in order to guarantee a packet loss probability which is smaller than the loss probability (P_loss) that has been specified for the connection.  However, in operation, the network traffic\n",
      "must be controlled dynamically which means that some packets may have to be dropped or discarded within the network to avoid traffic congestion.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In practice, it is common to reserve bandwidth for high priority packets (e.g. so-called Real Time or RT traffic) allowing such packets are transmitted in preference to lower priority packets derived from discardable traffic (e.g. Non Real Time\n",
      "or NRT traffic or more particularly Non Reserved or NR traffic).  Lower priority packets may be sent at rates greater than their declared rate to dynamically take advantage of any bandwidth remaining after all the higher priority traffic has been served. This remaining bandwidth can vary widely depending on the actual activity of the high priority traffic sources.  It is therefore of considerable importance to manage the low priority traffic so as to optimize the use of the widely varying left-over\n",
      "bandwidth in the network while avoiding any congestion which would reduce network throughput.  This obviously requires providing the network (and eventually also the sources) with congestion detection and flow control facilities.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Various mechanisms for controlling the flow of NR traffic have been proposed.  In particular, an Available Bit Rate (ABR) flow control mechanism has been proposed for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks.  ABR flow control is based on use of\n",
      "a particular flow control cell, the so-called Resource Management or RM cell.  RM cells are used to collect congestion information from network node switches along connection paths and to send such information back to the traffic sources.  While ABR flow\n",
      "control seems to be very efficient, it is complex to implement.  End systems must generate RM cells periodically, provide scheduling for RM cells to be sent among data cells, and shape their traffic in response to congestion indications conveyed by\n",
      "received RM cells.  Intermediate systems (switches along the paths) must be able to differentiate RM cells from regular data cells, extract RM cells and update these with congestion information.  These complexities limit the cost effectiveness of this\n",
      "solution.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Moreover, the above solution requires that all so-called non-reserved (i.e. low priority) sources connected to a network be treated using the ABR mechanism.  In fact, if a mix of ABR sources and non-ABR sources are connected to the network, the\n",
      "ABR sources will be disadvantaged as compared to the non-ABR sources which need not be capable of sending RM cells.  The customer must therefore update the hardware of all the end systems before using ABR support, which is an additional drawback from an\n",
      "engineering standpoint.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Finally, there is no description, in the ABR standard, of a policing function which could be used to protect the network from misbehaving sources or from non ABR sources.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Other mechanisms have been proposed, with flow control which can be used on ATM or PTM (Packet Transfer Mode, including variable length packets) traffic and offer good performance.  These flow control mechanisms add complexity to network\n",
      "equipment.  Access nodes or ports need to store tables of values and must have the capability of adding a time-stamp to the data packets or to specific control packets.  The overhead on the lines is also increased as at least a time stamp must be added\n",
      "to some transmitted packets.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A further improvement was disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,313,454 which made the system transparent to the user (source) by providing an internal congestion avoidance method.  To that end, congestion is identified throughout the network and\n",
      "transferred by setting an indicator in the packet header.  Then congestion indications are used in the destination node to generate a rate control message which is fed back to the entry node.  This prior art still adds overhead to the feedback flow if\n",
      "smooth and flexible congestion control is sought.  Otherwise, the flow regulation would be quite rigid and basic.\n",
      "<br/><br/>These functions are generally configured at connection setup and remain static.  A more flexible solution is necessary to be able to use the available bandwidth left by the reserved traffic while avoiding high packet loss inside the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>The present invention is a method for performing congestion detection and flow control operations for data traffic, including both discardable and non-discardable traffic, in a high speed digital packet switching network including access and\n",

      "back to the entry node by setting a Return Congestion Indication (RCI) bit in a second predefined header field in the data packets of the traffic of the backward path; RCI bits in packets received in the entry node are integrated over a predefined period\n",

      "<br/><br/>FIG. 1 is a general block diagram of a packet transmission system 10 showing access nodes/ports 11 and 12 and intermediate or transit nodes (13), the nodes being interconnected by links or trunks.  The links or trunks may provide permanent or\n",
      "selectively enabled (dial-up) connections between pairs of nodes.  A network transit node may be attached to one or several access (entry or exit) nodes.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Each network node includes input/output adapters (including) buffers interconnected by a switch fabrics, together with data processing facilities providing data communication and network control services in the network node.  Data packets\n",
      "(including control data) received on an input adapter may be selectively routed on one or more of the outgoing communication links or trunks through the output adapters.  Routing decisions are made in response to information in header sections of the\n",
      "packets.  The network node also provides additional services such as calculation of new paths between entry and access nodes, the provision of access control to packets entering the network, and the provision of directory services and topology database\n",
      "maintenance.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A network access node may operate either as a source (entry) of digital data to be transmitted to another end node, or as a data sink (exit node), or both.  User A, for instance, acting as a data source utilizes an access node 11 to access the\n",
      "packet switching network 10.  The access node translates the user's data into packets formatted for transmission on the network and also generates headers used to route said packets through the network.  At call set-up, the entry node processing\n",
      "facilities calculates a path or route through the network from the source node (entry node) to the destination node (exit node).  To avoid overload on any of the links on the path, the path is selected using an algorithm that ensures that adequate\n",
      "bandwidth is available for the new connection, while optimizing the overall throughput within the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The act of selecting a path for a particular connection implies the allocation of network resources to users in order to guarantee their Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.  Various quality levels of service may be specified, some of them in\n",
      "order to satisfy real-time delivery constraints, others related to non real time data traffic transfer.  To that end, the origin node computes a path to the destination node that is capable of carrying the new connection and providing the level of\n",
      "service required by the new connection.  The Path Selection process uses data describing the current traffic load in the entire network (nodes and links).  Such data are stored in a topology database located in each node of the network.  If no suitable\n",
      "path can be found to meet all requirements, the connection is rejected.  Once, the origin node has found a suitable path, a set-up message is generated which traverses the selected route, updating the resource allocations (including bandwidth occupancy)\n",
      "for each link visited by the set-up message.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To maintain high network throughput, a path is selected and resources are reserved only at the time of the connection establishment.  The Path Selection process takes into account various constraints which come both from the user (quality of\n",
      "service requirements, user's traffic characteristics) and from the current network topology and bandwidth allocation.  In addition, the algorithm maximizes the network throughput by choosing a path with the least number of hops and which tends to achieve\n",
      "an even distribution of the traffic among the links.  Once an appropriate path has been selected, the network connection establishment process takes place, and only then are the resources along the path reserved.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Accordingly, the connections established for different sources may require different levels of bandwidth, different delay guarantees, and/or different loss probabilities.  Real time signals such as voice or video, for example, require being\n",
      "assigned higher priority levels than non-real time signals.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As already mentioned, such connection characteristics are negotiated along with the bandwidth requirements and enforced by assigning higher priorities to the transmission of real time signals and, in case of congestion occurring, discarding\n",
      "non-reserved packets before discarding reserved ones.  In other words network management must distinguish between guaranteed delivery traffic and so-called discardable traffic.  Nevertheless, optimizing the transmission of lower priority traffic is\n",
      "important.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Therefore and due to the bursty nature of data traffic, traffic should be continously monitored and a mechanism provided for adjusting low priority traffic or any excess traffic in excess, and controlling the assigned bandwidth dynamically.  For\n",
      "instance 85% of the total link bandwidth may be reserved for committed traffic, which leaves 15% of said bandwidth for dynamic assignment.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The present invention is a method and apparatus for optimizing the transmission of lower priority traffic while avoiding congestion in the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The design of adequate congestion schemes is extremely difficult for the following reasons: Overhead: A congestion scheme should not increase the traffic too much, in particular when the network is congested.  Even proposals of positive feedback\n",
      "schemes, i.e. schemes that give feedback when the network is congested, do not resolve the problem totally as they also consume resources.  Fairness: When the demands of all users cannot be satisfied, the share of satisfied demands should be fairly\n",
      "distributed.  But neither the definition of \"fairly\" is trivial, nor the meaning of what is considered to be fair is invariable.  Responsiveness: The quality of the available resource is often changing dynamically.  A congestion scheme has to react\n",
      "quickly to changes by asking users to increase or to decrease their sending rates.  On the other hand, in order to maintain good throughput, only persistent congestion should be taken into account.  Short term loading of the queue due to traffic bursts\n",
      "should be differentiated from a persistent state of congestion.  Bad environments: Under congestion, packets can be dropped, changed or delivered out of order.  Despite such problems, the scheme has to continue to work.  Consideration of the totality:\n",
      "The final aim of a congestion scheme is to optimize the overall network performance.  Schemes that optimize the throughput of one user or one trunk, do not always maximize the overall performance.  Complexity: In high speed environments there are often\n",
      "only a few clock cycles to process a packet in a node.  Therefore, a flow control scheme has to be simple.  This criteria can also be called Implementability.  Misbehaving sources: Some congestion control schemes suppose that all users are able and\n",
      "willing to cooperate.  These schemes do often not work with misbehaving users.  Greedy users can degrade the QoS for other users or can even drive the network into long term congestion.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The aim of the system of this invention is to check the traffic by detecting congestion in any node of the network and then monitor the traffic flow accordingly on a port-to-port basis, while optimizing the network by complying with the\n",
      "requirements to avoid the drawbacks as indicated in the prior listed criteria, e.g. by minimizing traffic overhead, and yet enabling a smooth and flexible congestion control; being insensitive to misbehaving source users, and yet enabling a control of\n",
      "behaving sources at almost no additional cost; being perfectly implementable and rather not complex.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of a network implementing the invention.  It shows a connection set between a source end-user 20 and a destination end-user 21 through a digital communication network 22.  The network includes an entry access\n",
      "node/port 23 through which the source user 20 is attached to the network 22, while the destination user 21 is attached to the network 22 via exit access node/port 24.  Assume that, at call set-up, the source end-user's request for a connection had been\n",
      "executed by setting a forward path via transit nodes 25 and 26.  Since the traffic works both ways, Assume that the return path between user 21 and user 20 was established as indicated by arrow 27 also through a series of transit nodes (not shown in the\n",
      "figure).  Consider first traffic originating at user 20.  As already mentioned, in a packet switching system, source traffic is split into packets including a data payload and a header containing control information.  Packets may either be of fixed\n",
      "length as in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) of operation or be of variable length as in Frame Relay (FR) mode of operation.  According to this invention, the packets flows are monitored throughout the forward path, in each intermediate transfer node on\n",
      "the path.  As soon as traffic congestion is detected in one of the nodes, a predefined header field is marked or set to indicate congestion has been detected.  When a congestion indication is detected in exit node 24, each packet in the return path 27 is\n",
      "marked further congestion.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Again, we must say that this invention applies whatever be the type of traffic, be it organized in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or in Frame Relay (FR) mode.  But the mode of operation selected herein to describe the invention is the FR type\n",
      "(see FIG. 2).  Accordingly, each packet of data provided by the source (20) traffic includes a payload section and a Frame Relay header section (FR header)(see packet 28).  Now, for the purpose of this invention, each packet entering access node 23 is\n",
      "provided therein with a header.  The fields selected for both marking congestion indication (CI), through a so-called Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI) in any network node along the forward path going through nodes 25, 26, .  . . , and for\n",

      "<br/><br/>Now as far as implementation is concerned various flow regulating devices are already known in the art.  They are based on so-called usage parameter control (UPC) made to prevent connections from sending with different characteristics than those\n",
      "negotiated in the traffic contract, whether this is done on purpose or not.\n",
      "<br/><br/>One of these flow regulating systems utilizes a so-called leaky bucket (see FIG. 4 representing three different leaky bucket implementations (4a; 4b and 4c)) including an admission shift register (e.g. 41a) wherein the data packets are buffered\n",
      "and a so-called leaky bucket mechanism to control their passing further to the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Leaky Bucket label describes a family of algorithms with the same basic principle, based on the consumption of credits designated as tokens (see FIG. 4).  The tokens are generated at a rate .gamma.  and can be accumulated in a token pool or\n",
      "bucket (42a) with the size M. When the token pool is full, no more tokens are generated.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Each packet generated at a source has to pass the Leaky Bucket (see 40a) before entering the network and needs a certain number of tokens to pass.  The number of tokens can correspond to the packet size in bytes or for ATM, one token can\n",
      "correspond to one cell.  When no more tokens are available, the packet is dropped rather than being passed.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A full token pool means that a source may send a burst of size M at peak rate without losing a packet in the Leaky Bucket.  On the other hand, an empty token pool means that a source may still send at rate .gamma.  and all packets arriving at\n",
      "higher rate are dropped.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Leaky Bucket is determined by the parameters (.gamma.,M).  An appropriate setting of these parameters can be used to enforce the usage parameters.  For example, a low burst tolerance will be translated by a small M and the peak rate will be\n",
      "an upper bound for .gamma..\n",
      "<br/><br/>Various extensions to the basic Leaky Bucket represented in FIG. 4a, exist.  One of the most used is the extension to allow violation tagging.  As shown in FIG. 4b, two token pools (42b, 42b') are used in that case.  The second pool(42b') is used\n",
      "to allow excess packets to enter the network, but marked with lower priority.  The parameters .gamma..sub.r and M.sub.r are used for the second pool, called the red token pool.  Accordingly marked packets are called red packets and the tokens are called\n",
      "red tokens.  The traffic in the first pool is denoted green and is controlled by green tokens (see pool 42b).\n",
      "<br/><br/>For each packet, the green token pool is first checked to see if enough green tokens are available.  If there are not enough green tokens, the red token pool is considered.  If there are enough red tokens, the packet is assigned a lower priority\n",
      "before being sent into the network, otherwise the packet is dropped.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A third version of the leaky bucket may be implemented, ensuring Traffic Control, Priority Control and Traffic Shaping.  It is a Leaky Bucket linked with an entry buffer and a third pool: the spacer (see FIG. 4c).  Conceptually, the spacer\n",
      "receives the tokens from the leaving packet and is emptied at peak rate R. To send a packet immediately, two conditions must simultaneously be true.  The spacer must be empty and there must be enough tokens in the green or the red pool (42c42c').  In\n",
      "other words, a packet may not leave the system until the spacer is empty, even when there are enough red or green tokens.  In this way, the transmission rate can be controlled and can never be higher than R.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The implementation often differs from the concept, as the spacer is implemented as a scheduler.  The scheduler calculates the next possible departure time after the last packet with the peak rate R and attributes this time to the current packet.\n",
      "<br/><br/>This kind of mechanism is only applied to delay-insensitive traffic classes.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The general question for Leaky Bucket algorithms concerns the rate .gamma..  Which rate should be used for the reconstitution of the tokens and which bandwidth should be reserved for the connection ? This domain is called Resource Management and\n",
      "is widely documented in the literature.  The theory allows calculation, starting from the available buffer space and the traffic descriptor, of all the parameters of the Leaky Bucket.  The calculated parameters guarantee a very low loss probability with\n",
      "a certain interval of confidence for the data sent into the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>With these kinds of arrangements the network may be designed and managed to assign, say 85% of a link nominal capacity to reserved traffic and then dynamically monitor and control the remaining bandwidth and assign it to so-called excess traffic. The invention enables control of excess traffic at the network entry node to avoid network congestion without having to rely on traffic sources behavior.\n",
      "<br/><br/>This principle is schematically represented in FIG. 5.  A double token pool (51,52) is again used for controlling the traffic entering the network through leaky bucket mechanism 50 (possibly including a spacer not shown).  The token pool 51 is\n",
      "used to manage committed traffic whose delivery has been guaranteed at rate C_eq equal to the equivalent capacity that has been reserved for the considered connection in the network, or with a token rate which fits the minimum guaranteed bandwidth.  Any\n",
      "bandwidth (BW) adjustment through leaky bucket control (53) for committed traffic is then left to the source.  But for the excess traffic which by nature is discardable, it shall be handled under the path congestion mechanism of this invention using the\n",
      "EFCI/BECN indications provided by the communication network (54) to the network access node involved, to adjust the Excess Traffic (ET) token rate (55) and therefore adjust the excess capacity (C_ex) at network entry without involving the data source, by\n",
      "adjusting the token pool refill rate to R_r as required, to dynamically optimize bandwidth utilization while avoiding network congestion.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, for said excess/discardable traffic, the port algorithm may be designed so that the parameters will be adjusted according to the information of experienced congestion (RCI).  The above mentioned adjustments might be performed\n",
      "periodically, or integrated.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The algorithm as implemented in the source and destination ports of the preferred embodiment of this invention is summarized below.  It should be remembered that the action to be taken for packets with the RCI (e.g BECN) bit set to one, is based\n",
      "on additive increase or multiplicative decrease of the sending rate.  The parameter for the increase (i.e. the Rate Increase Factor (RIF)) is expressed as a quantile of the peak rate, while the Rate Decrease Factor (RDF) is a quantile of the actual rate. A new variable, i.e. the red token Refill rate (R_r) is introduced.  This rate is only used to calculate the increase and decrease and is translated into the Refresh period (R_p) at the end of the action per packet.  The rate R_r is not a real send rate. It is an upper bound for a possible mean send rate, due to its integration into the leaky bucket behavior.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The source port algorithmic steps for the adjustment of the leaky bucket parameters are as follows: 1.  When congestion is detected after integration of the RCI indications, the red token pool size (M_r) is normalized to the maximum packet size\n",
      "(e.g. 2 KB).  The refresh period is adjusted by conforming to the new M_r value (which is initially set to the time to send M_r with peak rate).  The red token refill rate (R_r) is derived from the red token pool size and the refresh period by the\n",
      "calculation R_r=M_r/R_p. 2.  For each congestion detected after integration of the congestion indications in packets, the rate is decreased by the factor RDF (0.85 for example) until the lower bound (5 kbps for example) is reached: If (R_r*RDF)&gt;0.005\n",
      "Then R_r is set to R_r*RDF; (the symbol * indicating a multiplication) 3.  For status of no congestion, after integration of the congestion indication, the rate is increased by the addition of the RIF multiplied by the peak rate until the peak rate is\n",
      "reached: If R_r+(R*RIF)&lt;R Then R_r is set to R_r+(R*RIF); where R is the actual access rate, 4.  The refresh period is derived from the red token refill rate: R_p:=M_r/R_r;\n",
      "<br/><br/>In other words, the system first starts with a check whether a congestion control action is needed.  In case of a positive answer, the red rate in the leaky bucket (i.e: R_r) of the source entry node (23) is decreased by the rate decrease factor\n",
      "(RDF) and the refresh period in the leaky bucket (R_p) is set to (M_r/R_r) wherein M_r designates the size of the red token pool in the leaky bucket.  Otherwise, the red rate in the leaky bucket is increased by R*RIF, with R being the actual access rate\n",
      "and RIF the rate increase factor and then the R_r period in the leaky bucket is refreshed.  In either case, R_r is limited to R.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Where the destination port (e.g. see 24 in FIG. 2) detects an EFCI bit set at binary value \"1\", it has to notify the transmit side of same network exit node adapter of the experienced congestion with the noted frequency.  The adapter transmit\n",
      "side will then mark all the packets of the connection travelling in the opposite direction (see 27 in FIG. 2) with the congestion indicator, i.e., will set the RCI bit in all the packets sent on the backward connection.  In this case, the destination\n",
      "port (24) does not smooth the information.  In fact, the value of the EFCI bit of the last packet received in the destination port (24) before the information is sent to the transmit side is decisive for the value of the RCI bit for the connection.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Thus, in the above described implementation no smoothing algorithm was applied on the receive side to convey the information back.  This can be explained by the aims of the algorithm: protect the network, i.e. avoid packet loss and use available\n",
      "bandwidth, even when the bandwidth is available for a short time period.\n",
      "<br/><br/>When congestion is experienced, the source port adapter has to be notified immediately to slow down the red token rate in order to avoid excessive packet loss.  That means, on the receive side, that when a port adapter receives only the last\n",
      "packet with the EFCI bit set and all the others did not have the EFCI bit set, it has nevertheless to convey the information about the detected congestion back to the source port.  On the send side two options can be used.  The port adapter may change\n",
      "the parameters of the leaky bucket to limit bandwidth use regardless of the number of RCI bits received at binary level \"one\".  As an alternative, the port adapter may integrate the RCIs to smooth the leaky bucket changes.  This smoothing phenomenon is\n",
      "particularly interesting as it enables substantial improvement in the congestion control with a minimal overhead.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The algorithm for implementing the inventive process is represented in FIG. 6.  At connection set-up, two parameters of the connection (in each direction), one for the number of set RCIs bits (nb_RCI_on), and the second used as a timer, are\n",
      "initialized.  The timer is set to zero and started, while the nb_RCI_on counter is set to zero.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Each time a packet is received in the backward direction (60), the RCI bit is extracted and tested (61).  If this RCI bit is OFF, the nb_RCI_on counter is decremented by one unit (62), else, it is incremented (63).  Then the timer indication is\n",
      "checked versus a predefined value considered as time-out indication (64).  As long as the time-out is not reached, integration over the RCI bit goes on, with the process looping back to step (60).  When the timer indicates a time-out, the integrated RCI\n",
      "bit indication is considered.  In a preferred embodiment, the congestion status is evaluated as follows: if nb_RCI_on is higher than zero as indicated by test (65), then congestion is declared and the actual red rate (R_r) is decreased as already\n",
      "indicated, by the predefined rate decrease factor (RDF) (see 66).  Otherwise no congestion is declared and the red rate in the leaky bucket is incremented by R*RIF (67), with R being the actual access rate and RIF the rate increase factor and then the\n",
      "refresh period in the leaky bucket is amended to R_p=M_r/R_r (68).  In both cases the timer is reset (69) and R_r is limited to R (70).\n",
      "<br/><br/>With the use of the timer, the flow control proposed integrates more or less depending on the data flow: if the backward data flow is important there will be a lot of \"up-to-date\" RCI information to process.  To avoid multiple changes in the\n",
      "leaky bucket parameters and useless processing, integration is performed.  If the backward data flow is low, each RCI indication is important and the integration is low.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The solution described with reference to FIG. 6 provides a valuable improvement over prior art while minimizing overhead traffic.  It can still be improved by providing more precise leaky bucket regulation, assuming several different levels of\n",
      "congestion and different RDF/RIF functions of these levels.\n",
      "<br/><br/>One implementation of such an improved algorithm is represented in FIG. 7.  The first series of operations (i.e: 72, 73, 74, 75 and 76) are identical to those described with reference to FIG. 6 (i.e: 62, 63, 64, 65 and 66), but once time-out is\n",
      "declared then the count of nb_RCI_on based on packets received over the feedback path is compared to achieve R_r=R_r*RDF2 with RDF2 being the largest predefined rate decrease factor.  Otherwise, if the test (77) is negative, a second test is performed\n",
      "(79) to check whether nb_RCI_on is between zero and th1.  If this is the case, then a decrease at slower rate (RDF1) is implemented (80) and R_r is made equal to RDF1*R_r; otherwise a third test is performed (81) versus a negative threshold th2.  If the\n",
      "nb_RCI_on is between zero and th2, then the rate is kept unchanged (82), otherwise it is increased (83) to R_r+RIF*R, with a limitation to the peak rate level (84, 85) and the token pool refresh period is refreshed to M_r/R_r; then the timer is reset\n",
      "(87).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Such an improved method and system enables a smoother rate regulation from the network entry access node and further enables driving the source user assigned window adaptation if required.  To that end, the rate variations defined here above:\n",
      "i.e. Increase (INC) (83), no change (NOCH) (84), slow decrease (BECN1) (80) and large decrease (BECN2) (78) shall be coded with two bits in the input access node and fed back to the source, as represented in FIG. 8.  These two bits may be selected in the\n",
      "two byte long Frame Relay header as defined in the ANSI Standards (see FIG. 9).  In a preferred mode of implementation of this invention, these two bits have been selected to be the third and fifth bits of the Least Significant byte (byte 2).  INC, NOCH,\n",
      "BECN1 and BECN2 are therefore coded accordingly.  With these two bits, the process is thus improved to control the NCP window feeding the source queue as illustrated in FIG. 8.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The four rate variations defined in FIG. 7, steps 78, 80, 82 and 83, while being used in the flow control operated in the network access node 23 in response to the network 22 congestion integration over the considered connection, are also used\n",
      "for source control.  This additional control is performed over the NCP window of source user 20.  Several window controls may be defined, but in the preferred mode of implementation of this invention, the window adjusments have been made as follows: if\n",

      "using these bits in a slightly different way.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In effect, when using one threshold only to detect congestion and set and reset the EFCI bit in the packet header, a typical threshold phenomenon can occur with oscillations around this threshold.\n",
      "<br/><br/>These oscillations could be avoided by a second \"unset-threshold\".  When a packet arrives and the queue size is greater than the set-threshold, the EFCI bit is set in all the packets.  Only when the queue size gets below the unset-threshold, the\n",
      "EFCI bit won't be set anymore.  This \"hysteresis\" avoids oscillations around one congestion indication threshold.\n",

      "short time periods of wrong information.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Once more the delay criterion has to be considered talking about two different thresholds.  When the queue size becomes smaller this means that the input rate is smaller than the output rate.  When the whole queue is empty, the link would be\n",
      "under-utilized.  The unset threshold should therefore be reasonably high, to inform the sources as soon as possible that the congestion situation does not exist anymore.  Knowing the already added delay we would tend to fix the unset-threshold higher\n",
      "than the set-threshold, which implies a certain complexity in implementation (the trunk has to keep track of the increase or the decrease of the queue size).\n",
      "<br/><br/>For implementation reasons an unset-threshold would add supplementary delay because it would be lower than the set-threshold, i.e. it would need more time to decrease the queue size to reach the unset-threshold.  This added delay would decrease\n",
      "bandwidth utilization as the sources would start later to recover from the experienced congestion.\n",

      "<br/><br/>In conclusion, a second threshold in the forward direction could avoid periods where some packets are marked and others are not.  This could theoretically increase fairness and reactivity of the sources.  Simulations showed, that there is only a\n",
      "minor difference between the use of one or two thresholds.  The oscillation periods are very short as the queue growth has always a clear direction upward or downward.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Some improvements to the invention efficiency might be obtained by focusing on a number of parameters in the implementation.\n",
      "<br/><br/>For instance, a modification in the way the packets are EFCI marked would lead to higher bandwidth utilization.  If, instead of being marked in the receive port, when they arrive on the adapter the packets are marked just before they are sent\n",
      "away (i.e. after buffering) the responsiveness of the system would be improved.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Responsiveness of the system might also be optimized by a careful selection of the Rate Decrease Factor (RDF) and Rate Increase Factor (RIF) of the algorithm.  For instance, the RDF and RIF values were evaluated for a range of trunk speeds from\n",

      "constant of 0.002*R.  The decreases are quasi exponential and the increase almost linear.  These values are key points in terms of responsiveness of the system.  The aim of the so called excess traffic controlled by the invention is to use even shortly\n",
      "available bandwidth.  Therefore the RIF should be preferably selected high enough to enable the system to adapt in few steps to a higher rate.  On the other hand, a too high value would increase the rate too fast, allowing the sources to send too much\n",
      "packets when congestion occurs before its notification reaches the source, leading finally to packet loss at the congested trunk.\n",
      "<br/><br/>On the other hand, a too small value would be inappropriate if the number of sources is low.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Therefore a compromise value should be selected carefully, based on the possible number of connections involved.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The RDF value should also be selected carefully to enable optimized adaptation to less available bandwidth.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The decrease of the rate must be done as fast as possible, because the congestion is always detected too late, due to the various delays the propagation of the information suffered from.  The exponential character of the decrease provides this\n",
      "fast response, in 1 sec, i.e. after 10 adjustments, the rate is at 20% of its original value.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A local optimization for each trunk speed makes not always sense as computer networks often integrate lines with different transmission speeds.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The red packet discard threshold has a direct impact on the ability to accept bursts and on the queue size, which is translated into added delay for the packets.  There are four main ideas behind the value of the red packet discard threshold: 1. \n",
      "Use the available buffer to accept bursts Each trunk is equipped with 256 KByte buffer space for the NRT and NR traffic classes.  This buffer can provide a great flexibility for the adapter to accept data bursts.  2.  Protect the green packets by leaving\n",

      "of 200 KB implies a sending a delay of 12.5 s at 128 Kbps.  This can lead to time-out events for NBBS messages and higher level protocols.  The queue size has therefore to be reasonably small to assure maximum sending delays of less than 1 sec per\n",

      "<br/><br/>This invention deals with problems of traffic control in the fixed length cells switching high speed networks and more particularly with a shaping method and apparatus to be implemented in an ATM network node.\n",
      "<br/><br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>The basic advantage of the new high bandwidth, low delay, fixed length cell based transfer mode techniques, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), is to allow multiplexing and switching of different types of information over the same network:\n",
      "data, voice, image, video, while optimizing the bandwidth and resources utilization.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To that end, the various network user's traffic are split into fixed and/or variable length data packets (or blocks) which are then split into fixed length cells in an ATM type network.  The basic problem is to conveniently orient these cells\n",
      "within the network bearing in mind that thousands of users connected to the same network shall share the same network link.  In a high speed transmission environment, and with users operating essentially in burst mode and at different speed from one\n",
      "another, one may easily understand that conflicts and congestions can occur within the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Congestion control inside these networks is one of the major problems to be resolved.  As the cells are short, no space is allocated in their headers to enable error recovery for the cell payload (i.e. users data).  If one cell of the block has\n",
      "been lost or discarded by the network in case of network congestion, error recovery is performed at the higher-level by recovery protocols retransmitting the user data block.  The error rate being extremely low in the internode links, cells lost because\n",
      "of random errors is not a potential problem.  However, when a node discards cells for reason of traffic congestion, it is unlikely that these cells will come from a small number of logical data blocks.  Discarding 1000 cells, if the average user data\n",
      "blocks length is 2KBytes (a low estimate), sent as 43 cells, may cause the network to absorb a retransmission of 43,000 cells! This case indeed is the worse case when the 1000 messages come from 1000 different connections.  That is why the protocols need\n",
      "to be efficient enough to minimize congestion problems in this type of networks.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In the ATM connection-oriented networks, the end-to-end traffic of data for one user, between the source and the destination, is represented by a Virtual Connection (VC); several Virtual Connections may be grouped in a Virtual Path (VP) that can\n",
      "be switched as a unit.  The bandwidth is allocated dynamically, based on predefined conditions and agreements with each user, as part of a connection setup signalling procedure that precedes end-to-end information exchange.  At call admission time, the\n",
      "source user provides, in addition to the destination point, a set of parameters, called the traffic descriptors, which attempt to describe the traffic that will be generated onto the links.  For instance, a mandatory descriptor is the peak cell rate of\n",
      "the connection, R. If this parameter is sufficient to fully describe Constant Bit Rate (CBR) connections, i.e., periodic stream of cells such as uncompressed voice, further parameters are necessary to describe Variable Bit Rate (VBR) connections such as\n",
      "those for video traffic.  The burst of traffic is measured by the average cell rate and the average duration of an emission at the peak rate R in most of the high speed networks literature.  As indicated above, in ATM networks, cells may be lost or\n",
      "unacceptable delays can be induced in case of traffic congestion.  Depending on the type of traffic conveyed over the ATM network, the first or the second just mentioned behavior of the network, in case of congestion, may damage the quality of traffic\n",
      "over the virtual connections: for voice traffic, cells can be lost but a delay in transmission is unacceptable.  When pure data is transferred on the virtual connection, the delay can be acceptable but not the cell loss.  That's why the network\n",
      "guarantees a Quality of Service (QoS).  The QoS guaranteed by a network is, in most cases, expressed in terms of cell loss probability and maximum end-to-end delay for a cell, independently of network topologies and protocols.  One can note that the\n",
      "end-to-end delay between two users is increased if the end-to-end connection crosses different network entities (private or public carrier networks) which have their own protocols and traffic management.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In order to meet the QoS, the network nodes have to control the traffic congestion both at connection admission time and once the connection is established.\n",
      "<br/><br/>At connection admission time the access node has to decide if it can accept the connection or not: its decision is based on the actual load of the links, and its analyzis of the traffic parameters of the connection.  Moreover, it has also to\n",
      "compute a path table to carry this overload of traffic through the different nodes.  If no path is found, the call is rejected.  It is important to note that the decision to accept a new call has to be taken not only if the network node estimates that\n",
      "the QoS for the connection will be met but also if it is sure that the added traffic will not have a significant impact on the QoS of all the connections already established.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A first control on traffic congestion, once the connection is established, is performed by the policing function implemented in a device, the policer, of the network access node adapter.  The policer will detect and penalize the violation of the\n",
      "peak cell rate on the current traffic compared to the one required at call set up.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Instead of the peak cell rate, another descriptor the Sustainable Cell Rate, (SCR) can be used as a criterion for the policing function.  Accordingly, any reference to the peak cell rate can be replaced by SCR.  The policing function is also\n",
      "referred to, in the ATM literature, as the Network Parameter Control (NPC) or the Usage Parameter Control (UPC) depending on whether the source unit is a Network Node or a Customer Premise Node (or port).  Indeed, an efficient policing function should be\n",
      "transparent as long as the traffic characteristics provided by the source at call setup are met.  This means that the policing algorithm should discard or tag as discardeable, user cells unless the cell loss probability is less than or equal to the one\n",
      "defined by the QoS.  On the other hand, the policing function will also discard or tag the cells that are in excess versus the peak cell rate provided at call set up.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A second control of traffic congestion consists in shaping the output network node traffic by spacing the cells departures in such a way that the time between two departures of cells for the same connection shall never be below the minimal value\n",
      "negotiated at connection setup time.  It has been shown that, on the average, the multiplexing of spaced cells tends to decrease the `burstiness` of the aggregate traffic and then allows a better utilization of the network resources.  This invention\n",
      "shall essentially focus on this second aspect of traffic congestion, and accordingly shall be implemented within (or combined with) the shaping device (shaper).\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 1 shows the shaping principle applied to the input cells stream 1.  The shaded cells have been sent by a first user and the cells marked with a cross have been sent by a second user.  The result of shaping is shown with the output cells\n",
      "stream 2: the cells marked with = have been moved and the departure time between two cells has become more regular.  The spacing of the cells is done according to the bandwidth sharing required by the users: in the output cell stream, the departure time\n",
      "between two cells is smaller for the cells of the first user than for the second user's cells, because the first user has required a greater bandwidth share than the second user.  Moreover, in the output stream the bursts of traffic have decreased: one\n",
      "can note that the groups of two cells belonging to the same connection of the input stream 1 have disappeared in the output stream 2.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The policing function is implemented in the access network nodes.  The device implementing the policing function, the policer, is part of the high speed adapter cards; it controls and, if necessary, penalizes the traffic entering the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The shaping function is implemented in the devices accessing a network: they can be Customer Premise Nodes accessing an ATM network or a Network Node at the boundary of a first ATM network and intending to access another ATM network.  As some\n",
      "Customer Premise Nodes can implement a policer, it is recommended to implement also the shaping function in the node at the boundary of a network connecting Customer Premise Nodes with policers.  The device implementing the shaping function, the shaper,\n",
      "is also part of the high speed adapter cards and controls the sending of the output traffic cells.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 2 shows a network node 5 which shall include shaper and policer functions.  Reference numeral 15 designates the input lines conveying the input cell streams which are received by the input adapters 10; in each adapter the policer controls\n",
      "and penalizes, if necessary, the cell stream for each user.  Then the cells are switched in the switch 30 and sent to the output adapters 20.  In each output adapter 20 there is a shaper which spaces the cells which are sent to the output lines 25 as\n",
      "illustrated in FIG. 1.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 3 shows an example of network topology to convey the traffic of users from the source unit 40 to the destination unit 60 through the networks 42 and 52.  In these networks the nodes 45 are the access nodes; the policers are implemented in\n",
      "these access nodes 45.  The shapers are implemented in the source unit 40 and in the node 50 which is at the boundary of the first network 42 and which accesses the second network 52.  As the destination unit 60 may be a Customer Premise Node having\n",
      "implemented a policer, it is recommended to implement also a shaper in the node 55 located at the boundary of the network 52.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Many policing schemes have recently been studied; some of the most known are the leaky bucket, the jumping window, the moving window as described by Raif O. Onvural in his book entitled \"Asynchronous Transfer Mode Networks: performance issues\",\n",
      "Artech House edition.  Without lack of generality, each policing function estimates one or more traffic parameters for a given period of time P. As this period of time P decreases, the policer may become non-transparent to users generating a traffic in\n",
      "conformance with the parameters negotiated at connection establishment time.  On the other hand, as P increases, the policer takes longer to detect that the source exceeds its declared characteristics.  However, the latter approach is more fair since it\n",
      "allows the user to generate a stream of cells that have short-term fluctuations.  This is done at the expense of more memory requirements at the node level.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The only policing function proposed as a standard by the ITU (International Telecommunications Union), is the Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA).  Details of the GCRA are given in the ATM Forum, \"ATM User-Network Interface Specification\", Version\n",
      "3.0, 1994.  Its role is, for each connection, to monitor the traffic arriving upstream according to the cell period T (T corresponds to the inverse of the peak cell rate R) and a given tolerance {character pullout} on this period.  Basically, a cell is\n",
      "assumed to be conforming if the time elapsed between the arrival of two consecutive cells (belonging to the same connection) is greater than or equal to T-{character pullout}.  If not, the cell is assumed to be non-conforming and is tagged and then,\n",
      "possibly discarded.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The policer discards cells not only because the source of traffic has violated the parameters negotiated at connection establishment but also because of a distorsion in the cell stream well known as jitter or Cell Delay Variation (CDV).  This\n",
      "distorsion is due to the queuing of the cells at each intermediate network node and more generally the multiplexing of the cells on the output lines.  The magnitude of the jitter depends on many parameters: the connection peak rate, the peak rate of the\n",
      "other connections that share the same link, the link load, the number of nodes passed through etc .  . . . A consequence of the jitter is to induce, as the user cells travel through the network, some distortion on the traffic parameters declared by the\n",
      "source upstream.  Especially, the instantaneous peak cell rate R' which may be modified and may pass beyond the value R declared by the source upstream at connection establishment time.  In the worst case R'&gt;R and the policing function with a short\n",
      "measurement interval (small period of time P) may take undesirable discarding actions.  This is typically the case of the GCRA when the specified tolerance {character pullout}, named Cell Delay Variation Tolerance (CDVT), is small.  That's why the\n",
      "shaping function will buffer cells so that the departure rate from a node is less that the arrival rate.  It has been shown that the multiplexing of spaced cells tends to decrease the \"burstiness\" of the aggregate traffic and then allows a better\n",
      "utilization of the network resources.  Policing and shaping control techniques should take into account the real-time constraints; as implemented in high speed network node adapters dealing with lines at several hundreds of Megabits per second.  For\n",
      "example, the cell transmission time (cell time cycle) is about 2.7 .mu.s for a line speed of 155.52 Mbps (OC-3), and less than 0.7 .mu.s for a line speed of 622.08 Mbps (OC-12).  This implies that the shaping and policing methods have a very short time\n",
      "to `manage` an incoming call.  For instance, assuming that only ten instructions are needed to both compute a cell transmission time and queue the cell to an output buffer; assuming that each instruction takes no more than one time cycle, the execution\n",
      "requires from the processor more than 14 Mips (Million of instructions per second) devoted to this task, for an OC-12 output link.  Usually hardware devices are preferred and only simple computations (a few software instructions) and basic manipulations\n",
      "of cells are possible.  As a consequence, shaping function will have to cope with a trade-off between complexity and performance and any step or device slowing-down the shaping process shall represent a serious drawback to the operability of the network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Taking into account these above performance considerations, two shaping schemes are briefly examined hereunder.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The first one, relies on a very basic principle: the shaping function sends a given number, p, of cells at the link speed C, and keeps \"silent\" (i.e. the cells are buffered) till p(C/R-1).\n",
      "<br/><br/>If this approach requires no computation nor complex operations at the cell level, the CDV induced is quite bad and the tolerance that should be accommodated at the GRCA level to accept all the cells would be typically p(C/R-1).\n",
      "<br/><br/>The second one, more sophisticated, is detailed in Eugen Wallmeier and Tom Worster's article entitled \"The spacing Policer, an algorithm for efficient peak bit rate control in ATM networks\", published in the Proceedings of the of the XIV\n",
      "International Switching Symposium, Yokohama, Japan, Oct.  25-30, 1992.  For an incoming cell of one connection, the time between two cell transmissions is such that the output peak rate is met, and the cell is queued to a list-of-cells that have to be\n",
      "sent at the same time tk.  This list is referenced by the nth entry of a cyclic calendar with N inputs.  A new entry of the calendar is sought at each cell time cycle, and the list-of-cells that have to be sent at time tn (0.ltoreq.n&lt;N) if any, is\n",
      "moved and queued to an output list.  In short, the following operations are done at each cell time cycle:\n",

      "<br/><br/>As one can see, the number of computations/manipulations is important.  Moreover, the size of the calendar has to be quite large to support connections with small peak rate (large T).  Although this algorithm gives good results in terms of CDV,\n",
      "it is impossible (without the knowledge of the aggregate incoming traffic pattern) to predict the jitter induced by the spacer.  Therefore, the tolerance that should be accommodated at the GCRA must be quite large to ensure a minimal cell loss\n",
      "probability.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Most of the existing shaping schemes rely on the following principle: they compute a cell transmission time at each cell arrival, which depends on both current time and the time when the last cell was transmitted.  For this reason, these shaping\n",

      "cells between source units and destination units, each said source units sending a source user traffic establishment time and information relative to the bandwidth sharing required, said adapter being equipped with a transmit device which reads the cells\n",
      "in a storage device and sends them onto said output lines at a rhythm defined by a table look-up operation of a so-called active calendar per each output line, each entry position of the calendar representing the position of one cell in the output line\n",

      "<br/><br/>splitting said calendars into so-called pages with n cells entries per page, n being a predefined number;\n",
      "<br/><br/>providing and associating to said calendars a Free Location Table organized into n-bits wide pages wherein each bit position in a page is associated to a cell entry position in the corresponding calendar page, said Free Location Table bit\n",
      "position being set either to 0 or to 1 depending on whether the corresponding calendar cell position is free or busy in the corresponding calendar page; whereby said calendar updating includes: for each new entry, locating the theoretical entry position\n",

      "<br/><br/>As already mentioned, the shaping function should be implemented to define the multiplexing sequence within a network output adapter or the transmit part of the adapter of a fixed length cell switching network node supporting node output lines. \n",
      "The nodes support transfer of information data for each node connected user between a source unit and a destination unit.  To that end the method and apparatus of this invention shall prepare in advance the departure sequence of cells, for all the\n",
      "traffic established in the considered network node, and thus help monitoring said traffic onto each individual node output line accordingly.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Represented in FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a transmit line adapter 20 located at an output of a node switch 30 switching data traffic between node input lines and node output lines.  This line adapter receives the fixed length cells sent by the\n",
      "switch 30 of the network node through a switch interface device 400.  Each fixed length cell contains a header including information on the Quality of Service (QoS) agreed upon by both user and network management.  The switch interface 400 sends the\n",
      "cells into a node storage area 410 where they are stacked into different queues 415.  Each queue corresponds to a different quality of service (QoS) and will be processed according to the corresponding priority.  For instance said priorities may help\n",
      "discriminating between real-time (RT) data, and non real-time data, the latter including for instance pure non-real-time (NRT) data and Non-Reserved (NR) traffic data including network control data.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In parallel, a general processor 435 continually receives, via a link 433, the messages indicating connection establishment, and fills-up a connection table 425 with information read from said messages.  For instance, in the connection table 425,\n",
      "the general processor 435 sends into each table entry an identifier of the input connection and an identifier of the output connection.  The connection table 425 is used by a routing device 420.  The router gets the cells, through the link 417, from the\n",
      "queues 415, starting with the queue with the highest priority; reads the input connection identifier in the cell header and gets the corresponding output connection identifier from the connection table 425.  Then the router 420 writes, through the link\n",
      "422, the considered cell in a queue 440 assigned to the corresponding connection within the storage area 430.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The traffic needs now to be shaped with a shaper mechanism 495 which shall multiplex the cells onto the node output line 25 while complying with quality of service and delay parameters specified for each user.  To that end, and as already\n",
      "explained, the shaper of this invention needs to be updated at each network modification (e. g. new connection set-up or breakup for instance), and this updating should be realized with a minimum time delay.\n",
      "<br/><br/>To that end, a system was already disclosed in the above mentioned copending application including the device of FIG. 5.  Accordingly, the general processor 435 fills up a User Table (UT) 535 containing in each entry a traffic identifier and the\n",
      "number of entries to be reserved in a so-called, standby calendar 557 for the said traffic.  The standby calendar operation is performed each time a traffic is added, changed or removed.  While the standby calendar is being updated, the active calendar\n",
      "559 controls the data cell multiplexing from the storage area 430 into the output line 25.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The general processor 435 of the node output adapter sends to a control device 540 of the shaper, via the link 537, the request for starting the standby calendar updating as User Table is ready.  Then the control device 540 sorts the data related\n",
      "to the traffic and updates two tables: a Bandwidth (BW) table 547 with the traffic identifiers in the descending order of the bandwidth share, and pointing to the second table, i. e. the Link Table (LT) 549, keeping all the traffic identifiers having the\n",
      "same bandwidth share.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The control device (CTL) 540 sends through link 543, to a placement device 550, the data to update the standby calendar 557.  These data are used by the placement device 550 which computes all the entries corresponding to one connection traffic. \n",
      "In parallel, the Active Calendar is scanned in sequence to control a transmit device 570 controlling the sequence of selection of cells which have been buffered into the buffers 440 and are to be transmitted via the node output line 25.  Once the Standby\n",
      "Calendar is updated the traffic shaping control switches from calendar 559 to calendar 557 which becomes the active calendar.  In other words, in this fixed length cell switching network, the shaping method implemented in the adapter, supporting the\n",
      "output lines, consists in scheduling in advance the departure time of the cells for each transfer of traffic between a source unit and a destination unit.  This is implemented through the use of two table look-up mechanisms (one active and the other on\n",
      "standby) per each output line of the node adapters.  The standby calendar 557 is updated at each traffic modification, then both calendars switch their functions with one another.  This corresponds to a so-called swapping operation.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, the active calendar is continuously read and the transmit device is activated at each entry read to send onto the output line the corresponding designated cell.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The above mechanism is schematically represented in FIG. 6.  The active calendar 559 is cyclically scanned by a calendar scheduler 80.  The User Table 535 includes next to each adapter user identification, the number of times the specified user\n",
      "should appear in the Calendar based on the user assigned bandwidth.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, the standby calendar updating shall often face conflicting situations when a calendar position designated for a nominal entry is busy.  One shall refer to that situation as a collision requiring looking for a neighbouring free\n",
      "position.  In the above mentioned co-pending application the calendar user positions are organized in a cell size.  This, unfortunately induces a high number of collisions and therefore leads to a slow calendar build-up.  This is a serious drawback in a\n",
      "high speed network environment made to process an important number of entries.\n",
      "<br/><br/>More precisely, said calendar updating operates as follows:\n",
      "<br/><br/>1.  Calendar is cleared\n",
      "<br/><br/>2.  Building of the calendar starts with the connection which has the highest share of the bandwidth (or first in sequence for same value)\n",
      "<br/><br/>3.  First entry of the calendar is updated with the ID of the connection.  Then all subsequent entries are evenly distributed so that the number of entries matches exactly the bandwidth fraction granted to the current user.\n",
      "<br/><br/>4.  Calendar building continues with the next user.  The first found empty slot is used for the first entry of the next user.  Then all other entries are evenly distributed from that point.  However, unless the next user is an integer division of\n",
      "the previous one, collisions are going to occur.  The next closest free position around the ideal position is searched for, until an empty slot is found.\n",
      "<br/><br/>5.  The above step repeats until the calendar is filled with all user entries.\n",
      "<br/><br/>This process may be considered too slow.  For instance, for a calendar size of 16384 entries, with 300 users with many connections implying a number of entries into the calendar close to each other but not equal (bandwidths ranging from 119 to 5\n",
      "Mbps).  Using a total of 16350 entries, 313756 acollisions were detected.  Accordingly, the elapsed time devoted to building an updated calendar was found to be about 54.4 ms.  This is not acceptable in terms of performance.\n",
      "<br/><br/>With the same parameters, the present invention required only 6.3 ms to build-up the calendar.  The corresponding performance is therefore increased by a factor of 8.6 with less than 1% impact on cell delay variation.  Bearing in mind the\n",
      "comments made about and relating to the invention background, one may easily understand the importance of the improvements provided by this invention from a practical stand-point.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The basic principle of the invention is to format the calendars into pages having n entries, rather than into cells providing for only one entry, as in the prior art.  Furthermore, a Free Location Table 700 is provided for use with the calendars\n",
      "(see FIG. 7).  There is one Free Location Table address per page.  The page size is defined by the width of the Free Location Table.  Each bit of the free location table is associated to a calendar cell address.  Then each bit position of the Free\n",
      "Location Table shall indicate whether the corresponding calendar cell address is free (bit at zero) indicating that no entry was already assigned this cell position.  Conversely, a bit set to one in the Free Location Table shall indicate that the\n",
      "corresponding calendar address is busy.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Before building the calendar, the so-called Free Location Table is cleared with all table bit locations reset to zero.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Represented in FIG. 7 is an n-bits wide RAM location storing the Free Location Table 700, with pages sequentially ranging from page 0 through page X, covering the whole calendar.  Accordingly, the calendar 702 is split into (x+1) pages also\n",
      "ranging from page 0 through page x, with each page having n entries per page where each entry includes a cell address.  For each new nominal entry, the highest weighted bit(s) (i.e. most significant bits) are used to address the Free Location Table page. Said page is read.  Should it contains only \"ones\" in all the selected page bit positions, as exemplified by page 3 of the Free Location Table 700 then collision is considered detected.  A page pointer is incremented or decremented one unit according to\n",
      "a predefined search sequence, e. g. +1, -1, +2, -2 .  . . until a Free Location Table page containing at least one bit free (i. e. at zero) is reached, in which case, an entry is performed in the nearest free position in the calendar and the\n",
      "corresponding Free Location Table bit position is set to one.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As it shall be described with reference to a best mode of implementation of this invention, the required hardware is quite simple.  In practice, two counters are used to perform a calendar entry.  The first one (COUNTER+) is used to scan the Free\n",
      "Location Table from the theoretical targetted position to its end.  The second one (COUNTER-) is used to scan the Free Location Table from the theoretical position to its begining.  A simple flip-flop latch may be used to determine whether the (COUNTER+)\n",
      "or the (COUNTER-) must be used to address the Free Location Table.  For instance when the latch is set to zero, the (COUNTER-) is used to address the Free Location Table; otherwise, when the latch is set to one, the (COUNTER+) is used to address the Free\n",
      "Location Table.  An \"entry address\" register holds the calendar address where the entry should be performed.  The most significant bits are used as page bits to address the Free Location Table.  The least significant bits are used as position bits to\n",
      "determine the entry bit position in a page.  A page status register holds the page status read out of the Free Location Table.  The whole process shall require three cycles C1, C2 and C3, with cycle C3 implying a conditional step leading either to a\n",
      "Cycle 3_Yes (C3_Y) or to a Cycle 3_No (C3_N).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Represented in FIG. 8 is a block diagram showing the hardware used in the best mode of implementation of this invention assuming a 16K address calendar and a 1K address Free Location Table (Table being 16 bits wide) are used.  More precisely the\n",
      "Table shall include 1024 pages.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The calendar scheduler 80 monitors the process by providing the C1 through C3 timing cycles.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Entry Address register 81 is split into two parts, a first part (ten bits wide part) is used to store page address; the second part (four bits wide part) is made to store position bits within the addressed page.  Said Entry Address register\n",
      "parts are controlled through logic circuits 82 and 83, respectively.  The logic circuit 82 is made of three sets of AND gates driving a common OR gate.  The ten high weighted bits (bits 0-9) of the theoretical entry position to the calendar are ANDed\n",
      "into first set of AND gates (1) when clocked by C1.  The second AND gate set (2) is fed with the COUNTER+ and the flip-flop latch output while being clocked with C3.  The third AND gate set (3) is fed with the COUNTER- output and the complemented output\n",
      "of the flip-flop latch, while being also clocked by C3.  These three AND gate sets output are ORed to control operation of the ten bits wide (page bits) portion of the Entry Address register 81.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The logic circuit 83 is made of two AND gate sets (4 and 5) to be ORed to drive the four-bits wide (position bits) of the Entry Address register 81.  The first AND gate set (4) receives, as entry, the four lowest bits (bits 10-13) of the\n",
      "theoretical position while being controlled by C1.  The last AND gate set (5) receives the inverted flip-flop latch 88 bit while being controlled by C3.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The 10 most significant (i.e. highest weighted) bits of the Entry Address register 81 are used as address pointer, to point at a page of the Free Location Table 700 and also provide the output information on the highest ten bits of the calendar\n",
      "entry address.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The Scheduler calendar 80 is also used to control read and write operations within the Free Location Table 700.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Also provided in this circuit are two logic circuits 84 and 85 each including AND gate sets feeding OR gates.  A first AND gate set of logic circuit 84 is fed with bits zero through nine of the theoretical position, while being controlled by the\n",
      "signal C1.  The output of said first AND gate set is used to increment the COUNTER+ device (86) by one unit.  Said COUNTER+ output is then fed back as input to the second AND gate set of logic circuit 84.  Said second AND gate set of logic circuit is\n",
      "also fed with a flip-flop latch (88) output and controlled by Cycle3_Yes signal provided by the scheduler 80.  The flip-flop latch 88 is set by C1 and toggled by Cycle3_Yes, both provided by the scheduler 80.\n",
      "<br/><br/>On the other hand, the bits zero through nine of the theoretical position are provided to a first AND-gate set of logic circuit 85, controlled by C1, to decrement the COUNTER- (87), one unit.  Said COUNTER- output is fed back as input to a second\n",
      "AND gate set of logic circuit 85 also fed with the C3_Yes signal, and controlled by the inverted flip-flop latch 88 output.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The data-out provided upon reading a Free Location Table page are loaded in the Page Status register 89 under the control of C2 signal.  The Page Status register feeds a Combinatory logic device 90 also connected to receive the four position bits\n",
      "from the Entry Address register 81.  The combinatory logic device 90 provides the four low weight bits of the calendar entry address, as well as data_in input to the Free Location Table 700 and an all_ones indication to the scheduler 80.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In operation, the process to perform a calendar entry is operated within the mentioned three cycles executed as follows:\n",
      "<br/><br/>Cycle 1: Initialization\n",
      "<br/><br/>The theoretical calendar entry position is loaded into the \"Entry Addr\" register 81.  The most significant bits of the \"Entry Addr\" give the selected page address into the Free Location Table.  The less significant bits of the \"Entry Addr\" give\n",
      "the theoretical calendar entry position into the selected page.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Simultaneously to the \"Entry Addr\" register load operation, the COUNTER+ is initialized with the \"Entry Addr\" value incremented by one and the COUNTER- is initialized with the \"Entry Addr\" value decremented by one.  On its side the flip/flop\n",
      "latch 88 (in charge of the future page address plus or page address minus selection when a collision is detected in the current page) is set to one.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Cycle 2: Read \"Free Location Table\"\n",
      "<br/><br/>A read of a Free Location Table position (ie \"calendar page image\") is performed during the Cycle 2 at the address given by the \"Entry Addr\" register 81.  The Free Location Table position content is transferred into the \"Page Status\" register 89.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Cycle 3: \"Is there no remaining free position into the selected page ?\"\n",
      "<br/><br/>Two cases are possible:\n",
      "<br/><br/>either the answer is positive (collision situation).  The process follows the \"Cycle 3 Yes\" branch of the flow-chart represented in FIG. 7.  A collision status is detected when all the \"Page Status\" register bits are seen set to one.  or\n",
      "<br/><br/>It remains a free position into the selected page.  The process follows the \"Cycle 3 No\" branch of the flow-chart.  A calendar entry can be performed into the current page position as close as possible to the theoretical position.\n",
      "<br/><br/>\"Cycle 3 Yes branch\" process.  A Collision has been detected\n",
      "<br/><br/>When the Flip/Flop latch 88 is set to one, the COUNTER+ gives the next Free Location Table position to be read (next page address).  On the contrary, when the Flip/Flop latch 88 is set to zero, the COUNTER- gives the next Free Location Table\n",
      "position to be read.\n",
      "<br/><br/>When the COUNTER+ is selected, its current value is loaded into the \"Entry Addr\" register 81 in place of the page bit range (most significant bits).  The \"positions bits\" are cleared (set to 0) in order to give a new theoretical position in the\n",
      "new page which is set as close as possible to the previous one.  The COUNTER+ is incremented again and the flip/flop latch is set to its opposite value to get a COUNTER- selection in the case where a new collision is detected in the new \"plus selected\n",
      "page\".\n",
      "<br/><br/>When the COUNTER+ is selected (Flip Flop latch set to zero), its current value is loaded into the \"Entry Addr\" register 81 in place of the page bit range (most significant bits).  The \"positions bits\" are set (set to 1).  The COUNTER- is\n",
      "decremented again and the flip/flop is set to its opposite value to get a COUNTER+ selection in the case where a new collision will be detected in the new \"minus selected page\".\n",
      "<br/><br/>The process will loop between cycle 3 to cycle 2 until a free position is found in a page of the calendar.\n",
      "<br/><br/>\"Cycle 3 No\" branch process.  A free position is found into the current page.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The calendar entry is performed at the page address given by the \"Entry addr\" register 81 most significant bits.  The exact position into the calendar page is given by the logic in charge of the detection of the remaining free position.  The free\n",
      "position is assumed to be located as close as possible to the theoretical position.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The bit corresponding to this position is set to one into the free location table page.  It indicates now that this calendar location is busy.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The above detailed operating cycles are summarized in FIG. 8.  Accordingly at cycle 1, a new entry process is initialized.  Then cycle 2 is made to read the selected Free Location Table location pointed at. Said page bits are analyzed at cycle 3. Should these bits be all ones, a collision situation is considered detected, and Cycle 3_Yes (C3_Y) is initialized leading to the page pointer being incremented or decremented (alternatively), and the process loops back to cycle 2.  On the contrary,\n",
      "should the page bits read at the begining of Cycle 3 contain at least one zero the Cycle 3_No (C3_N) is initiated.  This cycle is used to perform an entry for the currently processed cell in the nearest free position within the considered page.  Then,\n",
      "both the Free Location Table and the Calendar are updated accordingly.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Eventhough the proposed method may lead to some cell delay variation (CDV), the impact on CDV may be made relatively small, i. e. equal to the Free Location Table width divided by the calendar size.  For instance, for a calendar size of 16 384\n",
      "entries and a 16-bits wide Free Location Table, the CDV shall be 16/16 384=0.97% which remains fully acceptable in practice under current operating conditions.\n",

      "<br/><br/>1.  Field of the Invention\n",
      "<br/><br/>The present invention relates generally to communication channels and systems for transmitting data.  In particular, the present invention relates to a system and method for transmitting compressed digital video signals over a communication\n",
      "channel.  Still more particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for transmitting compressed digital video signals over digital subscriber loop (DSL) access networks and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks.\n",
      "<br/><br/>2.  Description of the Background Art\n",
      "<br/><br/>There are presently a variety of different communication channels for transmitting or transporting video data.  For example, communication channels such as digital subscriber loop (DSL) access networks, ATM networks, satellite, or wireless\n",
      "digital transmission facilities are all well known.  In fact, many standards have been developed for transmitting data on the communication channels.  The present invention relates to such communication channels, and for the purposes of the present\n",
      "application a channel is defined broadly as a connection facility to convey properly formatted digital information from one point to another.  A channel includes some or all of the following elements: 1) physical devices that generate and receive the\n",
      "signals (modulator/demodulator); 2) physical medium that carries the actual signals; 3) mathematical schemes used to encode and decode the signals; 4) proper communication protocols used to establish, maintain and manage the connection created by the\n",
      "channel.  The concept of a channel includes but is not limited to a physical channel, but also logical connections established on top of different network protocols, such as xDSL, ATM, TCP/IP, wireless, HFC, coaxial cable, etc.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The channel is used to transport a bit stream, or a continuous sequence of binary bits used to digitally represent compressed video, audio or data.  The bit rate is the number of bits per second that the channel is able to transport.  The bit\n",
      "error rate is the statistical ratio between the number of bits in error due to transmission and the total number of bits transmitted.  The channel capacity is the maximum bit rate at which a given channel can convey digital information with a bit error\n",
      "rate no more than a given value.  And finally, a multiplex is a scheme used to combine bit stream representations of different signals, such as audio, video, or data, into a single bit stream representation.\n",
      "<br/><br/>One problem with existing communication channels is their ability to handle the transportation of video data.  Video data is much larger than many other types of data, and therefore, requires much more bandwidth from the communication channels. \n",
      "Since transmission of video data with existing communication channels would require excessive amounts of time, compression is an approach that has been used to make digital video images more transportable.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Digital video compression schemes allow digitized video frames to be represented digitally in much more efficient manner.  Compression of digital video makes it practical to transmit the compressed signal by digital channels at a fraction of the\n",
      "bandwidth required to transmit the original signal without compression.  International standards have been created on video compression schemes.  These include MPEG-1, MPEG-2, H.261, H.262, H.263, etc. These standardized compression schemes mostly rely\n",
      "on several key algorithm schemes: motion compensated transform coding (for example, DCT transforms or wavelet/sub-band transforms), quantization of the transform coefficients, and variable length encoding (VLC).  The motion compensated encoding removes\n",
      "the temporally redundant information inherent in video sequences.  The transform coding enables orthogonal spatial frequency representation of spatial domain video signals.  Quantization of the transformed coefficients reduces the number of levels\n",
      "required to represent a given digitized video sample and is the major factor in bit usage reduction in the compression process.  The other factor contributing to the compression is the use of variable length coding (VLC) so that most frequently used\n",
      "symbols are represented by the shortest code word.  In general, the number of bits used to represent a given image determines the quality of the decoded picture.  The more bits used to represent a given image, the better the image quality.  The system\n",
      "that is used to compress digitized video sequence using the above described schemes is called an encoder or encoding system.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In the prior art compression schemes, the quantization scheme is lossy, or irreversible process.  Specifically, it results in loss of video textural information that cannot be recovered by further processing at a later stage.  In addition, the\n",
      "quantization process has direct effect on the resulting bit usage and decoded video quality of the compressed bit stream.  The schemes at which the quantization parameters are adjusted control the resulting bit rate of the compressed bit stream.  The\n",
      "resulting bit stream can have either constant bit rate, CBR, or variable bit rate, VBR.  CBR compressed bit stream can be transmitted over channel delivers digital information at a constant bit rate.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A compressed video bit stream generally is intended for real-time decoded playback at a different time or location.  The decoded real-time playback must be done at 30 frames per second for NTSC standard video and 25 frames per second for PAL\n",
      "standard video.  This implies that all of the information required to represent a digital picture must be delivered to the destination in time for decoding and display in timely manner.  Therefore, this requires that the channel must be capable of making\n",
      "such delivery.  From a different perspective, the transmission channel imposes bit rate constraint on the compressed bit stream.  In general, the quantization in the encoding process is adjusted so that the resulting bit rate can be accepted by the\n",
      "transmission channel.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Because both temporal and spatial redundancies are removed by the compression schemes and because of variable length encoding, the resulting bit stream is much more sensitive to bit errors or bit losses in the transmission process than if the\n",
      "uncompressed video is transmitted.  In other words, minor bit error or loss of data in compressed bit stream typically results in major loss of video quality or even complete shutdown of operation of the digital receiver/decoder.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Further, a real-time multimedia bit stream is highly sensitive to delays.  A compressed video bit stream, when transmitted under excessive and jittery delays, will cause the real-time decoder buffer to under flow or overflow, causing the decoded\n",
      "video sequence to be jerky, or causing the audio video signals out of synchronization.  Another consequence of the real-time nature of compressed video decoding is that lost compressed data will not be re-transmitted.\n",
      "<br/><br/>One particular communication channel that is becoming increasingly common is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks.  ATM networks are based on the ATM transport protocol which can be used to transport data or multimedia bit stream with\n",
      "pre-specified quality of service.  Unlike the xDSL standard, ATM protocols specifies how data is first packetized into fixed sized data units, called cells.  It also specifies how such a cell stream can be multiplexed, de-multiplexed, switched and routed\n",
      "between different locations to support end-to-end connections at given bit rate and/or quality of service (QOS).  In ATM networks, data bit stream to be transported are first converted into fixed sized ATM cells, each cell has a 5 byte header and up to\n",
      "48 bytes of payload.  Of particular interests to our invention is the capability of ATM networks to carry MPEG transport streams.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In ATM networks, connections can be established with pre-determined grade of QOS.  Conditions of network utilization, along with call admission control sometimes may prevent a new connection from being established at the given bit rate or given\n",
      "quality of service.  In such cases, the requested connection may either have to be rejected or a new set of admissible connection parameters have to be negotiated between the network service provider and the user requesting the connection.\n",
      "<br/><br/>ATM networks can be used to carry either constant bit rate (CBR) or variable bit rate (VBR) bit stream.  The bit stream may be compressed bit stream or data.  In either case, an agreement must be made between the user requesting the connection\n",
      "and the network service provider.  The connection agreement includes the bit rate profile of the bit stream and quality of service.  If such an agreement cannot be reached, either the connection must be rejected, or the bit rate profile must be modified,\n",
      "or the mismatched bit rates may cause periodic loss of data within the ATM networks, which results in corrupted bit stream in the receiver/decoder.  Specific decoded video quality depends on the decoder design.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The process of modifying the bit rate profile of the input bit stream is called traffic shaping.  The objective of the traffic shaping is to smooth out the burstiness of the ATM cell stream so that the resulting bit rate profile is more constant\n",
      "than that without traffic shaping.  Existing methods to do traffic shaping include using a large buffer to smooth out the bit rate fluctuation, or to selectively drop ATM cells during high bit rate period.  These methods were originally designed for\n",
      "connections carrying data streams or non-real-time multimedia bit stream.  In the case of using large buffers, data bit stream is not sensitive to large delay variations.  In the case of selective cell dropping, higher layer communication protocols will\n",
      "retransmit the lost information at a later time.  However, in the case of transporting real-time compressed video, none of the method is acceptable because of the tight constraint on the end-to-end delay variation.  For example, when ATM networks are\n",
      "used to transport MPEG-2 transport stream, the end-to-end jitter typically shall not be more than 1 millisecond.  The use of rate converter as traffic shaper will solve exactly this problem.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Within ATM networks data loss may also occur when there is not enough channel bandwidth to send all of the ATM cells.  In this case, ATM cells may be dropped from the overflowing buffers.  If the bit stream carried in the connection complies with\n",
      "the connection agreement, such event will occur very infrequently and falls within the bounds of the quality of service constraints.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Also, it is important to point out that in general compressed video bit streams are generated by either real-time encoders or pre-compressed video server storage systems, which are likely to be in a remote site, away from the network facility\n",
      "itself.  This implies that in general it is difficult to encode the video signal with a resulting bit rate profile tailored to the connection bandwidth available from the ATM network.\n",
      "<br/><br/>ATM network protocols are under intense international standardization effort and several industry wide inter-operable specifications have been produced, including the one specific on means to carry MPEG-2 transport streams over ATM networks using\n",
      "ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL-5).\n",
      "<br/><br/>Therefore, there is a need for a system and method for transmitting digital video information over data channels, that is simple to implement and has smaller delay, and can match the input bit rate to the channel bandwidth, resulting in a\n",
      "dramatically reduced bit error rate.\n",
      "<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "<br/><br/>The present invention overcomes the deficiencies and limitations of the prior art with a system and method for converting a bit stream of a given bit rate to a different bit rate for reliable transport over communication channels.  In various\n",
      "embodiments, the present invention includes: transmission of a compressed bit stream over Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines (ADSL) with rate adaptive capabilities (RADSL); transmission of a compressed bit stream over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)\n",
      "networks; flexible sharing of bandwidth of common communication channels among compressed bit stream and data traffic (including, but not limited to, data stream based on the ATM protocols or TCP/IP protocols, etc.); and statistical multiplexing of\n",
      "MPEG-12 transport streams.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A preferred embodiment of the system of the present invention comprises: a bit rate converter, a transmitter, a physical medium, and a receiver.  The bit rate converter is preferably coupled to receive an input signal that is a video bit stream. \n",
      "The bit rate converter adjusts the bit rate of the input signal to match the communications channel and then outputs the bit stream to the transmitter.  The transmitter is in turn coupled to the receiver by the physical medium.  The transmitter sends the\n",
      "bit stream over the medium to the receiver, where the bit stream is received.  Thus, the system of the present invention advantageously eliminates the need to decode and encode the bit stream before transportation over the channel.  The bit rate\n",
      "converter eliminates the need for decompression and compression and preferably comprises: a separation unit, a decoder and extractor, a plurality of modification units, an encoder and a combining unit.  The bit rate converter essentially adjusts the bit\n",
      "rate by making modifications to the video data portion of the bit stream.  The bit rate converter first separates the video data portion of the bit stream and then decodes and extracts the video data.  The data is then modified to change the bit rate,\n",
      "and then encoded and combined with the other signals that make up the bit stream.\n",
      "<br/><br/>A preferred method for transporting data over a communication channel comprises the steps of: converting a first bit rate of an input bit stream to a second bit rate, transmitting the bit stream at the second bit rate; and receiving the bit\n",
      "stream at the second bit rate.  The converting a first bit rate of an input bit stream to a second bit rate preferably comprises the sub-steps of separating the bit stream into video, audio and data portions, decoding the video portion, extracting\n",
      "vectors and coefficients from the video portion, modifying the extracted data, encoding the modified data, and combining the encoded video data with the audio and data portions. <br/><br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n",

      "<br/><br/>Referring now to FIG. 1A, a prior art system 10 for transmitting video data over a communication channel 19 is shown.  The system 10 preferably forms a channel 19 using an encoder 14, a transmitter 16, a receiver 20, a physical medium 18 coupling\n",
      "the transmitter 16 to the receiver and a decoder 22.  The encoder 14 receives an input bit stream 32 and compresses the input bit stream by encoding.  The compress bit stream is then received by the transmitter 16 and output over the physical medium 18. \n",
      "The transmitter 16 can be any one of a variety of those known in the art for DSL networks or ATM networks.  The signal sent over the physical medium 18 is received by the receiver 20 and input to the decoder 22.  The decoder 22 restores the bit stream\n",
      "received by decompressing it into its original format.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 1B shows a block diagram of a prior art system for transmitting video data over a communication channel showing the encoding and decoding function in more detail.  In particular, as shown, the encoding includes receiving raw video data and\n",
      "processing the raw video data with motion compensation 50, transform coding 52, quantization 54, and VLC encoding 56 to produce a compressed bit stream.  The compressed bit stream can then, because of its reduced size, be transmitted over any one of a\n",
      "variety of prior art transportation systems 58.  The decoding process is then applied to the compressed bit stream received from the transportation system 58 to obtain the original raw video images.  The decoding includes VLC decoding 60, Dequantization\n",
      "62, inverse transform coding 64, and motion compensation 66, all in a conventional manner.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 2A is a high level block diagram of one embodiment of a system 250 constructed according to the present invention for transporting video data.  The system preferably comprises a compression unit 252, a bit rate converter 202, a transmission\n",
      "system 204 and a data formatting unit 258.  The compression unit 252 receives video data and other data and produces a compressed bit stream.  The compression unit may perform any one of a variety of types of compression including but not limited to MPEG\n",
      "compression, H.26X or H.32X compression for video conferencing, compression using proprietary video stream formats, and compression of non-real-time data bit streams.  Those skilled in the art will recognize that the data formatting unit 258 is optional\n",
      "and provided only if additional data beyond the video data is being transmitted.  The data formatting unit 258 may add such additional data by either providing it to the compression unit 252 as just described or by providing it directly to the\n",
      "transmission system 204 as also shown in FIG. 2A.  The compression unit 252 provides a compressed bit stream to the input of the bit rate converter 202.  The bit rate converter 202 advantageously adjust the bit rate to match the bandwidth of the\n",
      "transmission system 204.  The bit rate converter 202 in its various embodiments will be described below in more detail, however, the bit rate converter 202 can perform conversion by adjusting or modifying the encoded bit stream syntax such as for the VLC\n",
      "decoding, the de-quantization, the inverse transform coding or the motion compensation.  The output of the bit rate converter 202 is provided to the transmission system 204 which formats the data and transmits it over a physical channel (not shown).  The\n",
      "transmission system 204 may be any one of a number of conventional transmission systems, including but not limited to ASDL, ATM/ADSL, ATM, ISDN links, Ethernets, public data networks, T1, T3, DS-3, OC-3, wireless/terrestrial networks, digital satellites,\n",
      "and digital cable networks, and particular ones are described below.\n",
      "<br/><br/>FIG. 2B is a block diagram of the preferred system for bit rate conversion according to the present invention, depicted using terms and reference numeral similar to the prior art system of FIG. 1B for ease of understanding and to show the\n",
      "advantages yielded by the present invention.  In particular, the FIG. 2B is annotated with arrows to show the advantages of the present invention.  As shown in FIG. 2B, the bit rate converter 204 includes a process of decoding, bit rate converting, and\n",
      "encoding in the compressed domain.  However, based on the modification units (see FIGS. 4 and 5 below) used in the bit rate converter 204, the bit rate conversion process effectively follows one of the paths specified by arrows A, B, C or D. Generally,\n",
      "motion compensation is most computationally expensive, transform coding and inverse transform coding are also quite expensive.  In general, without special hardware to perform these functions, motion compensation and transform coding will take over\n",
      "80%-90% of the overall decode-encode computation load.  The key to a simplified rate conversion scheme according to the present invention is therefore to bypass some of these expensive steps.  For example, in FIG. 2B, if we take the path B, motion\n",
      "compensation is avoided.  If we take path C, both motion compensation and transform coding are eliminated.  If we take path D, quantization steps are also eliminated, in addition to motion compensation and transform coding.  Of course, if we take path A,\n",
      "the entire decoding and encoding processes are performed, resulting in the most flexibility and quality potential, at the cost of being most expensive.  Each of these paths can be specified by the use of different modification units, 404, 406, 408, 514,\n",
      "516, 518 as will be described below with reference to FIG. 4 and FIG. 5.\n",
      "<br/><br/>While the present invention will now be described in the context of an Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop (ADSL) and ATM networks, those skilled in the art will realize that the present invention is applicable to a variety of other types of\n",
      "communication channels such as any xDSL includes ADSL, HDSL, VDSL, SDSL.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop, or ADSL, is a physical line code modulation scheme for transmitting digital bit stream over a single pair of plain old telephone system (POTS) grade twisted copper wires, that are usually noisy and are subject\n",
      "to outside interference.  Several schemes have been developed to achieve high channel capacity of the said twisted copper wires.  xDSL systems provide simple or full duplex raw bit pipes between the Central Office (CO) and the remote site receivers.  The\n",
      "material content and the format of the bit stream or the protocols used by the connections being established by the bit pipe is immaterial to the xDSL system itself.  In ADSL, the downstream link, from CO to remote site, has higher bandwidth than the\n",
      "upstream direction.  Downstream channel capacity is typically up to 8 Mbps, and upstream channel capacity is up to about 1 Mbps; the actual channel capacity depends on the noise level of the wires and the distance between the transmitter and the\n",
      "receiver.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Because broadcast video quality can be achieved with compressed video, such as MPEG-2, at 3-6 Mbps, ADSL provides an ideal delivery scheme for compressed digital video and other high speed data connecting COs with remote sites, which can be\n",
      "either consumer subscribers or business establishments.\n",
      "<br/><br/>However, because of the variation in physical line conditions due to both the physical distance of the connection and the noise conditions of the lines, the ADSL transmission schemes do not specify channel capacity in either direction, rather the\n",
      "channel capacity is determined at connection set up time via channel initialization and training by the transceivers at the CO location and at the remote locations, in a conventional manner.  The initialization and training process determines the proper\n",
      "coding configuration best matched to the current channel condition in order to achieve the maximum channel capacity.  During the connection, due to change in line condition or due to loss of data, the transceivers may also re-initialize and retrain to\n",

      "<br/><br/>Referring now to FIG. 9, a third embodiment of a system 900 for transporting video data integrated within the communication channel, in particular, for a rate adaptive asymmetric digital subscriber line (RADSL), is shown.  The present invention\n",
      "is directed toward the integration of bit rate conversion schemes with ADSL rate adaptation feature to achieve relatively lossless transmission.  Therefore, one key element of the invention is to create a synergy between the bit rate conversion of\n",
      "compressed video bit stream and the use of RADSL to transport compressed video bit stream, especially the transform coding based (such as MPEG) compressed video bit stream.  Throughout the present application, the term bit rate conversion has been used\n",
      "so as not to preclude the possibility of upward bit rate conversion, but in general practical applications, the need for downward rate conversion far exceeds the need for upward rate conversion.  Upward bit rate conversion can be achieved quite easily in\n",
      "different layers above the video compression layer, such as the transport layer (null transport packets), ADSL layer (bearer channel capacity configuration), etc.\n",
      "<br/><br/>As shown in FIG. 9, the third embodiment of the system 900 comprises an integrated bit conversion and transmitter device 902, a physical medium 18, a rate adaptive digital subscriber loop (RADSL) receiver 208 and initialization &amp; reconfiguration\n",
      "logic 908.  As shown, the integrated bit conversion and transmitter device 902 further comprises a bit rate conversion device 904 and a rate adaptive digital subscriber loop (RADSL) transmitter 906.  The bit rate conversion device 904 has a data input\n",
      "and an output, and is coupled to receive a compressed bit stream at the input on line 210.  The output of the bit rate conversion device 904 is coupled to the input of the RADSL transmitter 906 by line 910.  The bit rate conversion device 904 also has a\n",
      "control input coupled to receive a control signal from the RADSL transmitter 906 by line 912.  Thus, the conversion rate by which the compressed bit stream is reduced or increased is controlled by the signal from the RADSL transmitter 906.  For example,\n",
      "the bit rate conversion device 904 may be of the type described above with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Next, the RADSL transmitter 906 processes the bit stream from line 910 and outputs a bit stream over the physical medium 18.  The RADSL transmitter 906 is of a conventional type (for example, the RADSL transmitter 906 may be a Copper Gold ADSL\n",
      "chip manufactured by Motorola, Inc.  of Schaumburg, Ill.), and as will be described below with reference to FIG. 10; however, it is adapted to provide control signals to the bit rate conversion device 904.  In particular, the RADSL transmitter 906 is\n",
      "modified from a conventional type by providing an output for passing along rate control signals received at initialization or during operation.  A conventional RADSL transmitter is coupled to receive bit rate change control signals at either\n",
      "initialization or on-line mode.  The control signal is in the form of bit rate value that the RADSL transmitter can handle.  In one embodiment, this value is passed on to the bit rate conversion device 904 using line 912 to determine the targeted bit\n",
      "rate.  Those skilled in the art will realize that the method for passing this rate control signal form the RADSL transmitter 906 to the bit rate conversion device 904 is implementation specific and may be done using any one of a number of conventional\n",
      "techniques.\n",
      "<br/><br/>The bit stream passes over the physical medium 18 to the input of the RADSL receiver 208.  The RADSL receiver 208 is of a conventional type, and converts the information to a compress bit stream format which is output on line 214.  As shown, the\n",
      "RADSL transmitter 906, the physical medium 18, and the RADSL receiver 208 are each coupled to initialization &amp; reconfiguration logic 908 by line 914 to receive control signals as to how the data is to be coded and decoded before and after transmission\n",
      "over the medium 18.  The line 914 is also used to test the medium to determine capacity of the channel or medium 18.\n",
      "<br/><br/>While the initialization &amp; reconfiguration logic 908 is depicted in FIG. 9 as a logic block, those skilled in the art will recognize that the initialization &amp; reconfiguration logic in box 908 may be a suite of signaling protocols exchanged\n",
      "between the RADSL receiver 208 and the RADSL transmitter 906 so that each device knows what is the maximum achievable bit rates in each directions, such as is now conventionally done is RADSL channels, and is an integral part of the ADSL standard.\n",
      "<br/><br/>RADSL adapts the maximum channel capacity to the physical twisted wire 18 line condition by adjusting the coding configuration.  In the present invention, the bit rate conversion device 904 is integrated with the RADSL transmitter 906 and is used\n",
      "to adjust the output bit rate down from the input rate R to R.sub.1 (typically R.sub.1.ltoreq.R ).  This ensures that when the compressed video bit stream is received at the RADSL receiver 208 (decoder), the resulting bit stream maintains its data\n",
      "integrity and thus yields graceful quality degradation.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In the present invention, the channel capacity supported by the ADSL channel is advantageously conveyed to the rate conversion device 904 during the initialization stage.  In addition, on-line adaptation and reconfiguration of the supported rate\n",
      "must also be conveyed to the rate conversion device 904.  For example, with the ANSI (DMT) implementation, the maximum channel capacity the link can support at initial connection is signaled from the RADSL receiver 208 to the RADSL transmitter 906 in the\n",
      "R-B&amp;G phase of the initialization process.  In ANSI implementation, on-line adaptation and reconfiguration of bit rate are signaled via the ADSL overhead control (aoc) channel and the channel capacity can be increased in minimum steps of 4 kbps at an\n",
      "interval of 17 ms to about 43 sec selectable by the RADSL receiver 208.  This provides sufficient flexibility to the rate conversion device to properly setup the rate control parameters to perform the rate conversion.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Referring now to FIG. 10, a graphical representation of the reference model used for the RADSL transmitter 906 and an RADSL receiver 208 is shown.  ADSL is becoming widely deployed by major telephone companies and one particular implementation of\n",
      "ADSL, the Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT), has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).  In this standard, provisions are made to allow transmitter and receiver to perform initialization, training, optimum bit rate configuration,\n",
      "bit rate changes, etc. ADSL standard based on DMT is modeled as ADSL Transceiver Unit-Central office (ATU-C) and ADSL Transceiver Unit-Remote terminal (ATU-R).  This model is shown in more detail in FIG. 10.  From the model of FIG. 10, those skilled in\n",
      "the are will recognize that the RADSL receiver 208 has the same component blocks to perform the inverse function in ordered in reverse.  The RADSL transmitter 906 preferably comprises a multiplexing and synchronization controller 1000, a error correction\n",
      "and interleaver 1002, a constellation encoder 1004 and a DAC and analog signal processor 1006.  The bit stream is received by the multiplexing and synchronization controller 1000 which adds or removes control and synchronization information from the bit\n",
      "stream.  The multiplexing and synchronization controller 1000 is coupled to the error correction and interleaver 1002 which performs error correction such as a cyclic redundancy checking and forward error correction.  The output of the error correction\n",
      "and interleaver 1002 is in turn coupled to the constellation encoder 1004 which performs encoding on the bit stream.  Finally, the bit stream in converted to an analog signal, processed and applied to the physical medium 18 by the DAC and analog signal\n",
      "processor 1006.\n",
      "<br/><br/>Yet another application of the present invention is to Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks.  The present invention also includes the concept of traffic shaping, used on ATM networks to change the bit rate profile of ATM cell streams through\n",
      "the bit rate conversion of compressed video and has tremendous value in all future ATM network implementations.  Traffic shaping within the ATM networks using compressed video bit rate conversion is a crucial enabler of flexibly transport MPEG-2 video,\n",
      "as well as any other types of compressed video streams, over ATM networks.  The present invention creates a synergy between the bit rate conversion of compressed video bit stream and the use of ATM networks to transport compressed video bit stream,\n",

      "1106 is a conventional type known to those skilled in the art.  The integrated bit rate conversion device and ATM cell converter 1100 further comprises a bit rate conversion device 1102 and an ATM cell converter 1104.  The bit rate conversion device 1102\n",
      "is similar to those that have been described above with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5.  However, as shown in FIG. 11, the conversion rate is controlled by an external rate controller 1108 that is coupled to the bit rate conversion device 1102 by line 1110. \n",
      "In one embodiment, the external rate controller 1108 is logic or software that generates a control signal to specify a conversion rate that bit rate conversion device 1102 implements.  The external rate controller 1108 can provide external commands for\n",
      "setting a target bit rate out of the bit rate conversion device 1102.  The target bit rate out of the bit rate conversion device 1102 may be set based on several factors such as congestion condition within the ATM network 1106, connection level bandwidth\n",
      "negotiation between user and the network provider, etc. In yet another embodiment, the external rate controller 1108 receives control signals from the ATM network 1106 such as depicted in FIG. 11 by line 1112, for example from a remote network node. \n",
      "Such a remote node (not shown) can use the underlying conventional ATM signal protocol to provide rate control signals to the external rate controller 1108, as will be understood to those skilled in the art.\n",
      "<br/><br/>In this scenario, compressed video bit stream, such as MPEG-2 transport stream containing video programs, is being transported through the ATM networks from one location to another.  In this case, rate conversion scheme is used with the ATM\n",

      "bandwidth sharing, despite the fact that the available bandwidth from the transmission facility, which includes but is not limited to, xDSL, ATM, wireless channel, is sufficient to send the incoming compressed bit stream.  In general, for data traffic,\n",
      "such as TCP/IP based traffic, the data bit rate cannot be determined.  In addition, the video bit stream may not have constant bit rate, therefore, the resulting total bandwidth cannot be determined before the connection is established.  The application\n",
      "of bit rate conversion, however, will ensure that the resulting total bandwidth will always be less than the total available channel bandwidth.  To this end, some kind of priority scheme must also be used to ensure that no video data is lost. \n",
      "Specifically, when the total input bit rate exceeds the channel capacity, TCP/IP based data packets must be discarded by the transmission facility to ensure packets containing video data is not lost.  Therefore, there is a trade-off between how much bit\n",
      "rate reduction should be performed to the video bit stream, which results in graceful degradation of video quality, and how much throughput should be made available to TCP/IP based data streams.  These and other variations upon and modifications to the\n",
